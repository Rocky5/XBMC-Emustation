Welcome to Strangetown! The Sims 2 for Game Boy Advance is inspired by the weird town in the original PC game, but this time you're in a "reverse" reality show. Daddy Bigbucks (the villain from the game's prequel, The Urbz) is secretly filming a reality TV show in Strangetown, and pushes your own Sim to mix things up for the cameras.

You'll make friends and enemies, have romances, play minigames (some of which are thinly disguised as fictional commercial breaks), and participate in 11 standalone episodes, each with their own plots and situations. In one episode, you might be dealing with Don Fusilli and his mob, in another episode you might be battling lady bugs after being shrunk down to the size of a bug by a homebrewed cola.

Overall, the game is less of a simulation and more of a quirky adventure game through a colorful desert town.
