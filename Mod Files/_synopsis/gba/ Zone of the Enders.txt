In the distant future, mankind is at the brink of war with it's colonies on the moon, Mars and Jupiter. You take control of a young man who, after a series of events, finds himself in possession of a new type of L.E.V. (a giant combat robot) and stranded on Mars, where he joins forces with the Anti-Terrestrial League.

Gameplay alternates between Story sequences and tactical turn-based combat in which you control a number of L.E.V.s on a square grid map. There are different types of L.E.V.s that differ in speed, durability, movement range and armament. Unlike close ranged weapons, long range weapons cannot be used after an L.E.V. has already been moved. When two units engage in combat, the I.A.S. (interactive action system) comes into play. When attacking, you have a limited amount of time to move a cross-hair over your target. Critical hits can be delivered by successfully aiming at certain weak-spots of your enemies. When attacked by an enemy, you must try to keep your own target icon away from the enemy's. The IAS can be toggled on and off in the options menu.

At the end of each chapter, you can upgrade your L.E.V.s or equip them with certain items that can sometimes be found during missions. In the "balance" sub-screen, you can determine whether an L.E.V. should focus on attack power or accuracy, evasion or minimizing damage.
