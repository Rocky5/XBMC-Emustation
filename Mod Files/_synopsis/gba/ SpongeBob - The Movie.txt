Someone has stolen King Neptune's crown, and Mr. Krabs is the main suspect. Despite having been passed over for a promotion by Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob and his faithful (but dimwitted) friend Patrick volunteer to make the perilous journey to Shell City to retrieve the crown and save Mr. Krabs' life. Play as SpongeBob or Patrick as they interact with characters from the movie, earn "manliness" points to gain power-ups, and explore vast environments in the "Patty Wagon."
