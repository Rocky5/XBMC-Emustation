_________________________
Three years after your father was lost, you are an apprentice Craftknight. A tournament is held to find the next Craftlord and you're in it. But first, you need a weapon. Unlike many RPGs, you cannot find or buy weapons to use in this game. Instead, you must learn to make your own weapons. To make a weapon, you'll need to know the technique of making a specific weapon as well as the raw materials to make it with.

You aren't alone in the game. As a partner, you will get a Guardian Beast who will offer magic to help you in your battles as well as helping you make your weapons. You can get four different Guardian Beasts depending on your choices, each with different abilities.

Besides the tournament, you need to gather raw materials to make better weapons by travelling through a large dungeon and battling the creatures you find there in a side-scrolling battlefield similar to Tales of Phantasia. You will also have the opportunity to spend time with your summon creature and certain other characters each night. Who you choose to spend time with will affect the story somewhat.
