The Muppets, on with the show brings back Jim Hensons Muppets to the GBA. In this game, aimed at kids, the player has to help the Muppets to create a new Muppetshow, and to do so play a total of six activity games where the player controls one of the muppets and needs to perform. The game also has two hidden minigames that can be unlocked.

The general gameplay differs for each activity the game includes and involves racing, fighting, making music and evasion types of play. Each activity has an explanation screen that describes clearly what has to be done, and after the activity the player's score is expressed with a certain number out of five stars (max). The game can either be played in Story mode (easy/medium/hard) or activity mode where the player can play certain activities freely.
