The Scooby Gang must solve the mysteries of Spooky Island. Based on the live action motion picture, players must reunite the bickering gang, solve mysteries and fight the island demons. Every member of Mystery, Inc. is available as a playable character with different abilities; Velma solves puzzles (minig-ames) and can go unnoticed, Fred can fight, Daphne knows karate, Shaggy and Scooby can run, and run even faster, leaving enemies spinning in place. The player switches between each available character, as few as two, up to then entire Scooby Gang of Five, to progress through the world. Talk to people, collect clues and Scooby Snacks and solve the mysteries (quests) they present you, and fight off the monsters that have taken over Spooky Island.

In addition to the main gameplay, 4 mini-games are included, each of which aid the player in advancing through the game, by opening chests, turning on lights, fixing pipes and such.
