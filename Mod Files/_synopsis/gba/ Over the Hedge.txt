_________________________
In this game, based on the Dreamworks movie of the same name, players control RJ the raccoon and Verne the turtle. The levels consist of puzzles both inside the house and outside in the yard. Stella the skunk, Hammy the squirrel, and Ozzie the possum make appearances in the game.

The point of most levels is to collect candy which can be used to upgrade abilities or buy items to "decorate" the forest. Outside the player must avoid obstacles, such as pets, humans, and cars, and make it back to the hedge. The game is geared toward children.
