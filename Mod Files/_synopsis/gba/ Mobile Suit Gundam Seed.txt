Gundam makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with Gundam Seed: Battle Assault, an action game based on the animated series. Now you can take control of one of 12 different mobile suits and blast enemies with a variety of weaponry. Gameplay modes include solo missions and two-player versus mode, where you can link up to four Game Boy Advance systems for head-to-head action. Battle Assault also lets players adjust difficulty levels: Choose automatic or manual mode, and then adjust armor, HP, and energy gauges to maximize the challenge.
