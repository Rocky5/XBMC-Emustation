_________________________
Your father Josh Hunter, a Pokemon biologist, discovered something that awed the modern world. Pokemon powerful enough, develop a universal type. Creatures with universal type can learn all types of moves as well as being ghost and flying tpes (this means that normal and ground attacks don't affect them.) They all share Keen Eye and Trace abilities.

With the millions of dollars Josh made, he moved you, your mom and your older brother to the Jewel Islands from Hoenn. The Jewel Islands is a tropical string of islands located in the Obsidian Ocean. Each of the 10 islands is named after a gemstone: Diamond, Ruby, Saphire, Opal, Emerald, Amethyst, Aquamarine, Garnet, Topaz and Jade. Scenery varies from exotic rainforests, golden sand and glittering turquoise waters to molten volcanic plains, misty, black marshes and desolate bone-dry deserts.

The behavioral patterns if the Pokemon in the Jewel Islands allow corresponding types to live on the corresponding islands. Most grass pokemon tend to live on Emerald Island, most fire pokemon tend to live on Ruby Island, most psychic pokemon tend to live on Amethyst Island, etc. The weather patterns among the Jewel Islands seem a bit spiratic; snow at Mt. Axiom, bright sun at Seaside Atlantis and thunderstorms in the Swamp of Silence.

You are Josh Hunter's youngest child, Phil being your older brother. He had a successful career as a trainer and eventually became a gym leader specializing in legendary pokemon. You were inspired by both your father and your brother and wish to both become a gym leader by first defeating all other leaders and Elite Four in the Zephyr league, and continuing your father's research by collecting all pokemon of universal type. The problem with that is that only a few of the 24 are known so you have to collect all 386.

How to tell? It will say so in the pokedex.
