_________________________
Breaking the conventions of prior Pok?mon games, you play as a human who has suddenly been transformed into a Pok?mon, but before you could come to grips with this startling revelation, a Butterfree needs help! It's baby Caterpie has fallen into a dungeon and cannot get out!

You and other Pok?mon you befriend along the way must brave randomly created dungeons to help out other Pok?mon who find themselves in need of rescuing or just need something delivered. Both happen.

Unlike previous Pok?mon games, the battles take place on the map (though they are still turn based), and although you may only directly control the Pok?mon that represents you in the game, you can your companions vague battle orders. Such as: use more special attacks or conserve items.
