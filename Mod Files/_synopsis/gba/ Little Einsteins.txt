Inspired by the hit Playhouse Disney television series on the Disney Channel, Disney's Little Einsteins for the Game Boy Advance takes children on entertaining adventures with their favorite characters from the show.

A different piece of art opens each mission. Fly over mountains and through canyons, as well as gather instruments to play music.
