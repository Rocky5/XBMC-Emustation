The popular Need For Speed Underground franchise was adapted for systems with different capabilities. You drive around a city split into 5 distinct areas. As with the other versions, the aim is to drive well enough to boost your reputation. In this version the route is prescribed, without the exploration of the other systems. Available cars include machines from Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Toyota. There are less upgrades in this version, although the appearance and handling of your car can still be varied. The story in this version follows a predefined path.
