_________________________
Rijon Adventures is an overhaul of Pok?mon FireRed. It draws its appearance from Pok?mon Brown, another ROM hack from the Rijon Trilogy, and looks very similar to Brownthe region in the game is remade in Advance Generation glory. Most towns and areas are the same as from this.

But rijonAdventures is, by no means, a remake.

rijonAdventures takes place twenty years after. There are loads of changes that make this very much a new adventure. Move through many environments and survive numerous challenges to get to the top! If you've played Pok?mon Brown, there are a ton of changes that you will immediately notice
