_________________________
Control alternates between cartoon heroes Pinky &amp; The Brain in this side scrolling action game. Puzzles center around differing abilities between the two characters, e.g. The Brain being able to inflate his head, Pinky being able to jump higher etc. The game offers 16 levels, two controllable vehicles and five bonus games that can be played after they have been unlocked through progress in the game. The game also has a 4 player link mode via cable supporting the bonus games. Goal of the game is to take over the world - naturally.

This was supposed to be released in the US, but cancelled before release.  ~Rx
