Ripto and Dr. Cortex have combined their forces to take over the world once and for all. Right in the middle of it all our the heroes, Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon.

Spyro now finds himself in both familiar and unfamiliar territory, passing through the realms into Crash's world as well as his own to defeat the evil that awaits. Spyro's usual abilities are available as always.

Through-out, you'll find a collection of familiar characters from both the Crash and Spyro franchise, mini-games and multiplayer options. Collect the hidden trading cards and trade them with other players to get a complete set, or connect Spyro the Dragon Orange with a Crash Bandicoot Purple cartridge for unique connection options.
