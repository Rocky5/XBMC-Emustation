The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius - Attack of the Twonkies is a Game Boy Advance game based on the Nickelodeon Jimmy Neutron Halloween TV special of the same name. In the game, Jimmy explores a comet that is passing over Retroville called Twonkus-3, where he encounters a terrifying monster.

Upon returning home, Jimmy and his friends discover that an alien has stowed away with Jimmy. What starts to be a cute little pet turns out to be a huge menace when Jimmy discovers that the aliens (dubbed 'Twonkies') will evolve into monstrous creatures whenever they hear different types of sounds! It's up to Jimmy to use his inventions to save the town before the Twonkies tear it apart!
