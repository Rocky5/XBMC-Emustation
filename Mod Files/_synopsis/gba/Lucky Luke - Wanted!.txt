Based on the famous comics series about good cowboy Lucky Luke.

Now the Daltons are let out from jail and robbed the bank, and you have to chase them shooting at the bad guys, collecting extra lives, ammunition and dynamites, and collecting the four aces to access the bonus level. Meeting with the dog Rintincan is a checkpoint. Characters of the game points you where to go next.

The game is 9 (plus 4 bonus) levels in action with puzzle elements, but it has four mini-games also. The Arm-wrestling match, the Cannonball duel, the Single-shot duel, and the Cabaret Duel allow you to play with computer or with a friend, using a cable-link between consoles.
