Wolverine has just hours to find a cure to a virus and save his life. Along the way, he will discover further details on his past, and fight against other familiar characters from the X-Men franchise, including Magneto and Sabertooth.

Returning to the lab where Logan became Weapon X, you must use his unique abilities (adamantium claws and hightened sense of smell) to sneak your way around the areas past the many guards. And if needs be, you can use stealth abilities to quietly attack the enemy from behind or above.

Bonus objectives include finding hidden Wolverine comic covers and dog tags to unlock secrets such as new costumes and improved abilities.
