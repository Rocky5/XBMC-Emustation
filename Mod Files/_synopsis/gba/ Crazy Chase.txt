Far away in another part of the galaxy (roughly ten gazillion rubber chickens from Earth) floats Planet Clown. It's usually a rollicking place, but folks can't even smile since space pirate Dirty Joe nabbed Princess Honey. Can you track down Dirty Joe, save the princess and make Planet Clown laugh again?
