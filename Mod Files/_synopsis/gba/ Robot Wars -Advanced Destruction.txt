Robot Wars is a game based on a BBC television series where you control robots and engage them in combat with other ones in the four modes of the game.

In the Quickstart mode the CPU allows you to quickly step into battle by randomly selecting two robots from the ones available for a versus fight.

The Robot Workshop is where you can create and save up to four unique robot models and have them compete in any mode you choose.

From the Games mode you can select one of the following three: Championship, Vengeance Battle and Robot Mayhem.

- Championship is the place where you'll play against other robots to unlock more models.

- In Vengeance Battle you can choose your robot along with the opponent's one and also the arena that you want to play to.

- Robot Mayhem gives you no time restrictions and one round where you must destroy as many enemy robots as possible.

There's also a Multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete via the link cable.
