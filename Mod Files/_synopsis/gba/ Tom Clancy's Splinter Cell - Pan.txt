_________________________
The hand-held version features the same story as its console cousins, but tells it in a completely different way using a side-scrolling view with 22 different objectives and new locations to play in. The same stealth maneuvers can be used in this one as well: using shadows to hide, sneaking around, using human shields, forcing suspects to talk and even hide behind objects.

Night and Thermal vision can be used at any time and features three different scope views: Camera Shoot, Sniper and Laser Mic. Things like rappelling from rooftops and lock picking are still a part of the game, but is done in the form of mini-games.
