Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest is a swashbuckling sidescroller for the Game Boy Advance, based on the movie of the same name.

The game has two main modes of seafaring adventure. The first is an action sidescroller, where players take control of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow as he tries to reclaim his soul back from Davy Jones. He'll run, jump, and battle cannibals, pirates, the royal navy, and Davy Jones' monstrous crew across 15 islands, each made up of several maps.

Between the islands, players gets to captain Sparrow's ship, the Black Pearl. They'll need to equip her with food (otherwise the crew might mutiny!), cannons, and supplies enough to fend off privateers and pirates on the open sea.

Radically different than versions of the same title on other platforms, the Game Boy Advance version gives players a lot of gameplay variety over the course of the game. The open-ended island exploration, ship-to-ship battles, and "RPG-lite" upgrade system means that players can play this game in many different ways.
