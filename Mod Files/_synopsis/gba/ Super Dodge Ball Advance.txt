Super Dodge Ball Advance, based on the NES classic, takes place in the not-so-distant future when the sport of preteens has become the sport of kings and national pride hangs on the home team's ability to triumph in the number-one worldwide sport. Gamers choose a national team and compete against eight other countries in tournament-style bouts. You can knock the competition woozy with all sorts of different moves, customize your team by defining the attributes of your players, and play head-to-head against a friend's Game Boy Advance with the separately sold communication cable.
