It's the first Backyard Basketball for the Game Boy Advance, where you can create your own portable basketball team complete with wild power-ups, wacky courts, and junior versions of real pro players.

With each game, you can earn power-ups, boost your stats, and unlock more players, accessories, and courts. Backyard Basketball features three gameplay modes, plus head-to-head play with a Game Link cable.
