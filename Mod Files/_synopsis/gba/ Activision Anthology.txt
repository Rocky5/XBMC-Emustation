The GBA version of Activision Anthology is different from Activision Anthology: Remix Edition (Windows/Mac), Activision Anthology (PS2) and Activision Hits Remixed (PSP). It contains 56 games, more than the other versions, but it does not include the Imagic titles (Atlantis, Demon Attack, and Moonsweeper). A few of the extra games are homebrew.
