Based off the popular Sega CD and PSOne RPG title, Lunar Legend retells the story of Alex, the boy who aspires to be a Dragonmaster like his hero Dyne. Grouped with all of his allies from the original game, Alex and friends embark on the traditional fantasy adventure quest to defeat Emperor Ghaleon from discovering and abusing the hidden power that Luna holds.

This is a traditional turn-based combat RPG filled with magic spells, hidden weapons and quests to discover, and lots of humor in the overall story.
