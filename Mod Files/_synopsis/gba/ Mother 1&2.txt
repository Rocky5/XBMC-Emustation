In what is certainly their most retarded move since Giftpia, Nintendo of America said to themselves "Nah, the English-speaking world is not interested in cool games like Earthbound. Here, check out Mario Pinball Land! Wowee!" So now the translation burden rests on the fans. It is a sad state of affairs. And yes I'm still pissed about Giftpia damn it.

So yeah, this is the first two Mother games. Mother 2 was released here as Earthbound on SNES. The first game is available in English as an NES prototype, which you can find if you feel like looking for it.

Translation Description

The first game is mostly done, using the script from the NES prototype. The second game only has basic menus done, just to show that it can be done.

Basically this is just a teaser patch, to get translators to help out, since RPGONE wants the game to be completely retranslated. So that is nice.
