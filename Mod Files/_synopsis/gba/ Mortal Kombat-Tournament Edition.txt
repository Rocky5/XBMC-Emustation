_________________________
This semi-sequel to Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance brings together a handful of the previous characters with a host of new and well-known faces making their debut on the GBA, including Bo Rai Cho, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Sareena, Nitara, Cyrax, Mavado, Reptile, Hsu Hao and Drahmin.

Game modes include a collection of new multiplayer modes, such as the Race to Raiden, where two players compete against a set of characters, and the first to reach and defeat Raiden wins. Up to 4 players can compete in Tournament mode to see who is the best fighter.

Plus there's plenty of single player modes including Survival, while you can link Tournament Edition with Deadly Alliance to play some of the multiplayer modes.
