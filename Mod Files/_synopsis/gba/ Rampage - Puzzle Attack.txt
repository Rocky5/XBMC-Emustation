_________________________
Through a range of different play modes (both single and multiplayer), you must clear the playfield of four different coloured block types (red, blue, green and yellow).

Using a similar game style to the Game Boy classic, Tetris Attack, a line of blocks sits above the play field which you can change the order of and drop two at a time onto the blocks below. Once a Detoblock (a block that is different in appearance to the usual blocks) appears, drop it onto the corresponding colour to clear those blocks from the field.

Play modes include Clear (clean the playfield of all blocks), Puzzle (try and clear all blocks within a set number of drops), Marathon (the usual play as far as you can mode) and Rescue Mode, where you must clear the blocks from the top of a cage, in which the many monsters from the arcade hit, Rampage World Tour, are trapped in.

2 player modes include Rescue (free the monster before the opponent to win), Score (score the most points in 1 minute) and Attack, in which the blocks you clear from your field appear on the opponents screen.
