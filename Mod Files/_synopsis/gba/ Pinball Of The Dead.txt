_________________________
Based on "The House of the Dead" arcade/dreamcast series, this is a simple combination of pinball and the evil dead. Three pinball tables, Wondering, Movement, and Cemetary (all based on areas seen in The House of the Dead and The House of the Dead 2) are infested with zombies and using your silver ball, you must take out the zombies to save the table. The more you take out, the more points you get and the better the opportunity to take on one of the final bosses.
