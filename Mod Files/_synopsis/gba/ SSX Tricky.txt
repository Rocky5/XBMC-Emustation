SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The ?bertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six ?bertricks in a row results in a super ?bertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play.

Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.
