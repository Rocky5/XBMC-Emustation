Open Season for GBA is based on the movie and it is a completely different game experience than the console version. The story in the game follows the movie pretty well and it is well presented through in-game and comic dialog style cinematics. It's about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy with his domesticated home. But one day he gets in trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town's authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker, Beth.

The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has many cool moves. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is your job to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to scare off the hunters!
