Shrek has put together is own ogre kart and is now challenging to win the Dragon's treasure, along with 7 other characters based on the hit 3D animated movie, Shrek.

Swamp Kart Speedway is similar in design to Mario Kart Super Circuit, using the Game Boy Advance's scaling system to create the illusion of 3D worlds.

There is a total of 16 tracks to race through, each based on a well known fairy tale as well as places from the movie, along with 4 magic enhancement spells to improve your kart, 2 evil magic spells to create damage, and 4 boss characters to defeat (and unlock to play as in single and multiplayer modes).
