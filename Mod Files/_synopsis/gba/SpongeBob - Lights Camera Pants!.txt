_________________________
SpongeBob SquarePants: Lights, Camera, Pants! is different from its counterpart for Windows or the consoles. Like in the other versions the the popular TV series "The New Adventures of Mermaidman and Barnacle Boy" is in danger because the cast has failed to show up. It is up to the player, as SpongeBob to find a replacement cast in the inhabitants of Bikini Bottom.

The Game Boy Advance version plays like a classic side-scrolling platform game. The levels end with level bosses that have to be defeated in a style mimicking Dance Dance Revolution. Additionally the player can play a variety of mini games in between games.
