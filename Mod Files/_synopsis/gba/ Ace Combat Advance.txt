The Air Strike Force (A.S.F.) is the most advanced aircraft squadron on the planet. Not held by any nation, they are owned by General Resources Ltd. who begins to assign the A.S.F. to duties designed to destroy competition and put them at an economic advantage. Alarmed by this dominance, the nations of the world ally themselves to form the United Air Defense (U.A.D.) whose goal is to fight the war on the A.S.F. and destroy their weapons capability.
