The Pok?mon story begins with our hero, Ash, in his home region of Kanto. The day he has been waiting for has finally arrived; he can now begin his journey, leading him toward his destiny to become the Greatest Pok?mon Master of All Time! Ash receives his first Pok?mon, Pikachu, and their journey and friendship begin.

A company of Squirtles have joined forces with Team Rocket and stand in the path of our heroes' enthusiastic march.
