Summer is just around the corner, and the kids from Ocean Shores look forward to the Annual Ocean Shores Surf Contest. But as Otto, Reggie, Twister, and Sam finally reach the beach, they make a startling discovery--most of the sand is missing, and the surf contest has been postponed. Now it's up to you to guide the kids through Ocean Shores, The Lakes, The Robot Factory, and Mondo Mountain in the effort to discover who stole the sand. In each area, you'll battle robot minions, use the new wave runner and zip-line glide, and play extreme sports, such as skateboarding and inline skating.
