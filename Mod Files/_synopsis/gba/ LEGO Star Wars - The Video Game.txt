Relive the adventures of the Prequel Trilogy (Episodes I, II and III) in Lego form! Players take control of over 30 characters to play through key moments from "The Phantom Menace", "Attack of the Clones" and "Revenge of the Sith", including all of the famous lightsaber battles, races, and spaceship dogfights.

The Lego aspect also comes into play, as bricks will be built to pass obstacles and be used to guide the characters through their journey. All of the environments are styled and break apart just like the toy line of the same name.

Also included is a multi-player mode, with multiple extras and characters to unlock throughout gameplay.
