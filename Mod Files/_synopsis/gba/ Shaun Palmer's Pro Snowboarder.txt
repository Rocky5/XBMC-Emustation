The player chooses from a group of snowboarders that include Shaun White, Ingemar Backman, Tara Dakides and the game's namesake, Shaun Palmer with 16 different tracks in four different locations and authentic snowboards with more being unlocked through gameplay. There are a variety of game modes that include Tutorial, Free Ride and VS that allows two players to compete head-to-head and a Career mode.

There are a variety of styles, each with their own set of rules and gameplay such as Freestyle that judges the player on complicated tricks performed during races on either how complicated or simple the trick is as well as if they landed perfectly or fell on their behind. Palmer X has the player compete against computer opponents on a downhill slope while Superpipe has the player complete a course within a certain time-limit in order to advance.
