_________________________
Spyro the dragon returns for his first adventure on the Game Boy Advance. This time, Grendor has turned all of the fairies of the Dragon Realms into ice blocks, sending out his band of Rhynoc warriors to collect them, and use them to stop his headache. Only the fire power of Spyro, with Hunter and Sparx on hand to help, can save the fairies from a certain Panadol future.

Unlike the Playstation series, Seasons of Ice has you controlling Spyro through an isometric overhead camera. However, all of Spyro's skills are still available to use, including his flame breath and glide. And the flying bonus levels (similar to that of the original Sonic series of bonus levels) will use Mode 7 technology to create the 3D like perspective (as used in Mario Kart: Super Circuit and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity)
