This time, Nancy Drew has to solve a mystery of a haunted mansion in San Francisco.

The villa seems to be inhabited by ghosts... But this is not all. Somewhere in this strange house lies a treasure. That's why you are not the only one interested in this mansion...

Compared to the previous games of the series, "Message In The Haunted Mansion" underwent serious changes: it is 360 degree with full motion freedom. It also has two difficulty levels.
