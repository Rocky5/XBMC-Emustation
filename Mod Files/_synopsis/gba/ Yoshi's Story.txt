For the unveiling of the Game Boy Advance in 2000, Nintendo developed an original technical demonstration, or "tech demo," that was based directly on the first level of Yoshi's Story. This tech demo was developed specifically to show off the Game Boy Advance's graphical power. While the gameplay was slower, it looked identical to the Nintendo 64 game.[21] A full version of the game was never released for the Game Boy Advance.
