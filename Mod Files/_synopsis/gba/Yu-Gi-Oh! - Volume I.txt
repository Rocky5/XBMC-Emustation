Take a break from trading Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, and watch two episodes from the series that started it all. Yu-Gi-Oh!: Volume 1 for the Game Boy Advance includes the last two episodes of the "Friends 'Til The End" series. In part three, Joey is freed from Marik's spell, but now he must duel without the Millennium Puzzle. In part four, you'll find out whether Yugi and Joey, who were once best friends, actually send each other to his respective doom.
