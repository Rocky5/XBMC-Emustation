This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.

The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.
