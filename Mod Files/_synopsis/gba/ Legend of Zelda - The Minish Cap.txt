While at a festival with Princess Zelda, Link encounters a mysterious mage, called Vaati, who turns the princess to stone. Helpless to stop them, Link is asked by the king to meet with a race of tiny people known as the Minish, who may be able to help with their predicament. On his travels, Link teams up with a talking cap called Ezlo, who is able to shrink Link to the size of a Minish so that he can meet with them. With his newfound abilities, Link must save the kingdom from Vaati's menace.

The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap is a top-down action adventure game that tells the origins of the evil Vaati from Four Swords. Players take on the role of Link as they conquer various dungeons to retrieve essential tools to fight enemies and progress through various obstacles. Items such as the Mole Mitts allow Link to dig through dirt, while the Gust Jar can be used to suck in enemies, items, and propel Link. Link can also shrink down to the size of a Minish with the aid of Ezlo, the talking cap.

The Minish Cap uses the gameplay mechanic of shrinking to make familiar territory new and different. Puddles become huge rivers, baby chicks are huge monsters, and regular enemies become deadly bosses at Minish size. Link can also trade items called "Kinstones" with people in the game - when two pieces of the same Kinstone are joined together, new areas open up, treasure chests appear, and sometimes, even useful rewards are given to Link.
