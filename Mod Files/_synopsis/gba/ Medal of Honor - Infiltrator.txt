_________________________
Medal of Honor Infiltrator is a shooter from a top-down viewpoint. The top-down graphics and gameplay are reminiscent of classic games like Commando and Frontline.

In its 15 total levels, Infiltrator brings together a variety of different play styles that should be familiar to anyone who's played their fair share of 8- and 16-bit games.

You can hide behind houses and other buildings to stop enemy bullets. If you come across a stationary gun or a tank sitting in a level, you can put these weapons to use against the enemy. Each level has a number of mission objectives assigned to it, such as locating documents or destroying ammunition depots. To complete a level, you need to accomplish these goals.

The difficulty level is, like its forerunners, high and urges the players all the time.
