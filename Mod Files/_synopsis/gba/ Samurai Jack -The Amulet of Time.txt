Based on the Cartoon Network animated series, Samurai Jack has been sent to another place in time by his nemesis Aku. Attempting to find a portal home in order to restore time from the twisted reality he currently fights through, Jack discovers an amulet will aid him in returning home. However, pieces of the amulet have been placed all around the world, so it is up to Jack to find them.

You must explore every corner of each level to find pieces of the amulet, while fighting a range of powerful enemies using your sword and other weapons, while each piece of the amulet will give Jack new magical abilities that will aid his progess. When you recieve a new ability (such as doube jump), you can then enter areas that you previously could not reach.
