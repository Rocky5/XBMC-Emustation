_________________________
Based on the Gamecube series of the same name, Super Monkey Ball Jr. has you in control of 3D style arenas, each with a varying degree of difficulty and objectives. Your little monkey, inside a ball, relies on your movement of the arena to get to the required objectives (collecting items, getting to the finish line in under a certain time limit, etc.).

Apart from the single player puzzle experience (which includes more then 60 arenas), up to four people can play a collection of mini-games (which you must unlock in the single player game). Play monkey bowling (aka ten pin bowling), monkey fight (knock the other 3 players' monkey ball out of the circle arena) or an 18 hole mini golf challenge.
