Wakeboarding is the new addition to the Activision line of extreme sports titles.

A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sports name).

Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.

Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks.
