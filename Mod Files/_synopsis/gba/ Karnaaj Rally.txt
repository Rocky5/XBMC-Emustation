Crying. That's what your opponents will be doing when you're at the wheel. Race from a top-down perspective as you steer down one of 22 tracks. Blast ahead with gas and brake control. Make your opponents spin and crash as you bombard them with a barrage of weapons. Take your competition out of the race with rockets and mines. Earn money every time you win to buy newer, faster vehicles and weapon power-ups for more fire action.
