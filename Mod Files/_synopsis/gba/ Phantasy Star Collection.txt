This collection contains the original Phantasy Star trilogy, together in one game. Phantasy Star has you leading a group of warriors, working in the arts of combat (both offensive and defensive) and magic, through a maze of evil into the heart of where it resides. It is your job to destroy it, in this case, three times over.

- Phantasy Star - travel to the Algo Solar System and take on King Lassic, who has brought the menace of evil to the galaxy.

- Phantasy Star II - a new evil is taking over the planet Mota, and only you can restore peace and defeat the deadly forces that come in waves on your path victory.

- Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom - although defeated, evil still finds a place in the galaxy. Take your party to 7 different worlds through 3 generations, and use all you have to rid it once and for all.

The Saturn version has Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium as well.
