WCW is known by many wrestling fans, the only real competition for the WWE. (Back then called the WWF) In this game, you combat with greats like Sting, Ric Flair, Dustin Rhodes, and Scott Steiner. Will you succeed?

Directions:
There are three types of game-play.

In single match, you face one opponent.
In tag team, you team up with another wrestler to face a team of two!
In Tournament, you must win matches to advance, and if you get to the end of the bracket, you win!

In Ultimate Challenge, it's kinda like a singles match, sorta. You face one opponent at a time, though. You get many other opponents!

There are two modes of play: One Player and Two Player
