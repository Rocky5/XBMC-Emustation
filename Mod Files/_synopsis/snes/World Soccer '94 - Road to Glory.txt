_________________________
The first game in the long-running soccer series, which stood out from the crowd with a unique forced perspective 3D view rather than a simple overhead one. The players are drawn large and there is a large scanner to assist with long passing. However, the standard mode has the ball sticking closely to the feet, which makes mazy runs upfield a more useful strategy. There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.
