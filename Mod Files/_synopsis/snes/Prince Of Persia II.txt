_________________________
Similar to the first Prince of Persia, the character explores various deadly areas by running, jumping, crawling, avoiding traps, solving puzzles and drinking magic potions. Prince of Persia 2 is, however, more combat-heavy than its predecessor. In the first game, enemies appear only occasionally and are always alone, while in the sequel, up to four enemies may appear at once, sometimes flanking the player, and may even be instantly replaced by reinforcements when they are killed. As in Prince of Persia, the trick is to complete the game under a strict time limit that passes in real time. Lives are unlimited, but time cannot be regained except by reverting to a previously saved game. In other areas, more significant improvements have been made. The graphics are far more complex than the simple look of the game's predecessor, the areas explored are larger, and the variety of backdrops is greater.

Setting:

The game takes place eleven days after the events of Prince of Persia, in Persia, as well as various other locations. During this period of eleven days, the Prince was hailed as a hero who defeated the evil Jaffar. He turns down all riches and instead asks for the Princess' hand in marriage as his reward, to which the Sultan of Persia reluctantly agrees.

Plot:

Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame begins as the Prince enters the royal courts of the palace. Before he enters, however, his appearance turns back into that of a beggar. Nobody recognizes him, and when he attempts to speak with the Princess, a man who shares his appearance (apparently Jaffar, magically disguised) emerges from the shadows, ordering him to be thrown out. With guards pursuing him, the Prince jumps through a window and flees the city by way of merchant ship.

The ship is struck by lightning, cast by Jaffar, just as a mysterious woman appears in the barge and asks the Prince to find her. He regains consciousness, and finds himself on the shore of a foreign island.

As the Prince fights his way back to Persia, he finds many useful tools in his quest against Jaffar. At one point the Prince's mother[citation needed], revealed to be the mysterious woman on the ship, shows herself, and explains about her husband's death, and her plight to abandon the Prince so that he might live. In a temple, the Prince finds that he can separate from his body, transforming into the shadow that Jaffar's magic mirror created in the events of Prince of Persia. The Prince uses this motive to steal the sacred flame of the temple, and then travels back to Persia. Here he immediately encounters Jaffar, who flees. The Prince transforms into the shadow bearing the blue flame once again, and casts fire at Jaffar, defeating him. The Princess awakens from the spell Jaffar set upon her, and the Prince orders the former Vizier's ashes be scattered. As the Prince and Princess ride into the distance, however, it is revealed that an old woman is watching them through a crystal ball.
