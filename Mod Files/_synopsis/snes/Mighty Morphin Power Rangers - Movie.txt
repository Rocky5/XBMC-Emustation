Ivan Ooze is taking over the world, starting with Angel Grove, and it's up to the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers to stop him. Run through the streets of Angel Grove fighting putties, robots, and Ooze men. Only you can save the world from this horrible menace.

Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie is a fun game and worth playing. It features good graphics which include morphing, enemies, and backgrounds. The music keeps with the traditional soundtrack of the TV series. This game, however, doesn't exactly follow the movie as far as Ninja Rangers or new Zords. It does keep somewhat with the story-line as far as Ivan Ooze being the bad guy, and the Ooze men. Come to think about it, that's about it. This game remains, however, a fun and entertaining game, so give it a chance and play it. Sit down, Log in, and have fun!

Directions:

Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: the Movie is a fun side-scrolling Beat-em-up game that brings all the fun of the Movie and the TV series to the game screen. Choose which of the rangers you want to play as: Tommy, Billy, Rocky, Kimberly, Aisha, or Adam, and then run through the streets beating up on the bad guys.

This game lets you play on 1 player and take on the world by yourself; or a 2 player mode, which lets you fight side by side to save the world from Ivan Ooze!

In most sections of the game, the screen is divided into two different areas, for example the street and the sidewalk. Press the L or R buttons to switch between these areas. Note that you can sometimes use this to avoid enemies, but they will sometimes follow you if you switch.

Along the way, you can pick up Power Bolts from fallen enemies, which increase your power bar on the bottom of the screen. Pressing "X" before the power bar is full shoots a ball of energy at the enemies. Pressing "X" when your power bar is full will morph you into a Ranger, which gives you a more powerful attack. Filling the power bar again will give you use of the Ranger's special weapon, such as Rocky's sword, Billy's staff, Kimberly's bow, Adam's Axe, and Aisha's sais. Also, along the way you can break capsules which contain big power bolts (that give you a lot of power) or food which increase your health (located on the bottom left of the screen).

Run through all seven levels, which start on the streets of Angel Grove and end in Ivan's Ooze Fortress, and fight the bosses at the end, such as Mirror Maniac, Cannon Top, Skelerena, Magnet Brain, Silver Horns, Main Frame, and finally Ivan Ooze. The last two before Ivan Ooze are large and require a strategy, as opposed to the ones before, which are more or less beat-em-up and avoid getting hit. Ivan Ooze is actually two bosses, with the first fight being the same size as the rangers. The last fight with Ivan, he grows huge and requires a strategy to defeat.

No matter which Ranger you pick, you only get three lives and four continues. After using a continue, you are given the chance to choose a new Ranger or stick with the one you had. Defeat Ivan Ooze and save the world, it's as simple as that. Good Luck, Gamer.
