--From the SNES WWF Super Wrestlemania instruction manual.

Overview:

Wrestling is, by many people, the sport of kings. In this game, you get to tangle with some of the greatest grapplers of the 90's, like Hulk Hogan, Undertaker, Randy Savage and many others!

The object here is simple: defeat your opponent(s). In order to do so, you must weaken your enemy with suplexes, body slams, and other moves. There are three game modes: One-On-One, where you and one opponent duke it out, Tag Team, where two teams of two fight off against each other, and Survivor Series, where it's 4-on-4. If someone gets pinned, they are eliminated. After all the people on one team are eliminated, the other team wins. There are 10 wrestlers to choose from: "Macho Man" Randy Savage, Jake "The Snake" Roberts, The Undertaker, Hulk Hogan, Hawk, Earthquake, Animal, Typhoon, Ted DiBiase and Sid Justice.
