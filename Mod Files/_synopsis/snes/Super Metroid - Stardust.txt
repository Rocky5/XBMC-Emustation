Welcome to Super Metroid: Stardust!

Special thanks to Deep_Space_Observer! Without him this would have never been released!

If you wish to see videos of this hack go to my Youtube channel (tyjet66).

Tricks required to beat the game:

Mid-air Morph

Double Bomb Jump

Walljumping

Infinite Single Walljumping

This hack is about as non-linear as they come (if I'm correct) and it has the same amount of final items as the original. The difficulty of this hack is kinda on the low end, so if you want more of a challenge let me know, I might make a harder version. This is my first hack so tell me what you think!
