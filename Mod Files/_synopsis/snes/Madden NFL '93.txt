_________________________
John Madden Football '93 is a football video game released in 1992 by Electronic Arts. While technically just an update of the '92 game, this one set the bar for most Madden games to follow.

This is the second Madden game for the Super Nintendo. The John Madden games have been a commercial success and have appeared on the Sega Genesis, the Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, Sega Game Gear, and Nintendo Game Boy.

The game is featured in the collector's edition of Madden NFL 09 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as an exclusive bonus, including updated rosters for the 2008-2009 season.

Features:

John Madden Football '93 featured 28 updated teams from the '91-'92 season, as well as 10 new teams: 2 All-Madden teams and 8 Greatest ever teams. The teams featured in the game were represented by city names. There were no player names, logos, or arena names used, due to those rights being held by the NFL and the NFLPA. John Madden Football '93 was the first in the Madden series to incorporate "split-play calling", overturning of certain calls by referees, the use of the No-Huddle Offense, and player taunting.

Easy defense
Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 93 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place. When the ball is snapped, you'll usually have plenty of
time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.
