The year is 2015. After the economic wars of 2011, most of the free world has become a commodity to be bought and sold for profit. Many companies had been fighting for the Earth's resources, but one company rose to the top. That company was Deutchland Moldavia.

By buying up most of the Earth's remaining resources, DM became a power stronger than any Government. At first, DM claimed peace and prosperity as its goals. But as the challenges in uniting a planet grew more difficult, the President of DM, a man named Trip Iago, became delirious with the power he had gained.

DM had always been involved in research on many levels. But Mr. Iago had big plans for his company. By working on a type of genetic manipulation, DM learned how to change a human into a mindless slave or a powerful being.

Four people were affected by DM's evil research: Flynn, Echo, Al, and Prokop. Each one found reasons to seek revenge on DM. After the harm DM had done, all four swore that they would stop DM, even if it meant their own destruction. 

~From the Manual

Gameplay:

A one to two player game (four player for versus mode), The Peace Keepers spans multiple endings along with having multiple paths to take during the course of the game. There are six selectable characters in the game. The game is not exactly presented in 2.5D form like its predecessors, but instead presented in ? view and plays out like any other brawler or beat em up would. You run through a slew of enemies, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. The controls are the standard punch, special attack, taunt, jump and block. Using taunt followed by your special move button allows for a super move to be used. The bosses you face and when you meet them depend on the paths you take through out the game.

Tips:

Both players can choose the same character
Highlight 1P game, hold L, R, & Down both controllers.  The cursor should then be in '2P Game', press start on controller 1

Secret Move
If Flynn's energy is below 10%, he can turn into his fire haired superhuman mode. Hold R, and press Down, Down + Right, Right, and X

Start Story Mode with All Six Characters
At the Jaleco Logo, hold L, R, A and press START. Hold the buttons down as the game starts

Secret Character
If you go up to the door at the end of the first stage without going in, then return to the beginning, you will find a secret character

Stalag 17 Warp
If you go up to the door at the end of the Roy D Tutto Hospital stage without going in, then return to the manhole you passed in the street, you will find it is open. It is a shorcut to the Stalag 17 stage

Weird death
If you play as Prokop up to the Ozymandias stage, then play as any other character on that stage, Prokop will be killed when you go down the flight of stairs.
