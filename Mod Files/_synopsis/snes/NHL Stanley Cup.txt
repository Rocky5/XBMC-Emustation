NHL Stanley Cup lets all 26 teams from the National Hockey League at the time of the game's release (including the expansion Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks of Anaheim) compete for the highest honor in professional hockey, ]]. As it licenses from the NHL, but not the NHLPA, the game can use the team logos and the Stanley Cup but not the names of real players. Despite this, the players have strengths and weaknesses that correspond to their real-life counterparts, so e.g. Pittsburgh Penguins #66 or Los Angeles Kings #99 have an easier time scoring. You can substitute for or pull your goalie and institute line changes, but not line edits, as you see fit. Gameplay modes consist of Exhibition, Season and Best of Seven Series. Options include three different period lengths (5, 10 or 20 minutes) and having the penalties and line changes turned on or off.

This game mimics real ice hockey in that you can shoot, pass or dump the puck, and you can perform hip, shoulder and poke checks. You can even fake a slap shot and aim your shot on goal to a particular corner of the net. Hockey is an overtly brutal sport, and this game reflects that, but there are numerous penalties that you can commit, including tripping, cross checking, slashing, roughing, hooking, interference, icing and offsides.

A special Mode 7 viewpoint gives you a three-dimensional perspective that helps you keep your eyes focused on the puck, the center ice and the surrounding action. Battery backup lets you save your progress throughout the Stanley Cup playoffs. Other features include season and game statistics, three difficulty levels (Junior, NHL and NHL Pro), and the ability to skip games against particular opponents. After the end of each game, a sportscaster will give you a complete wrap up of the action.
