This is a review that, honestly, does not need to be written. Basically, everyone who could ever hope to love a series like Super Robot Wars already knows about it. It's a mecha fanboy's wetdream; it brings together mecha from all these different anime into one universe, and has them fight each other in pretty wicked little fight animations. What's the official SRW3 count? Gundam 0079, Char's Counterattack, Gundam 0080, Gundam 0083, Z Gundam, ZZ Gundam, Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, UFO Robo Grendizer, Yuusha Raideen, Getta Robo, Daitarn 3, Choudenji Robo ComBattler V, and the Masoukishin originals. Whatever those are.

I'll be blunt here. This is a nice, decent strategy RPG, but if you're like most non-Japanese who have never even heard of most of those series, then you simply won't enjoy the game. Which is also why you will never, ever, see these games outside of Japan. This is a game made by fanboys for fanboys, and anyone who falls into that category will absolutely adore it. Have fun, you crazy guys you!

Translation Description:

Everything's complete, except for (of course) a few tiny bugs. Play the game!

Tips:

Sound Test
During any scenario, go to an empty square and press A (menu button), third-last option (SYSTEM), press A (confirm), and go to third option (SOUND).  Then, Hold SELECT then press A

Tips:

Neo Granzon
Once you've completed Masaki's and Ryuune's route, your save file should have the letters 'MR' meaning Masaki
and Ryuune. Restart the game and on the Banpresto starting blue screen press 'Down, Up, Left, Right, L, R' before the screen fades. It should turn pink and when you start Shuu's route, you will start with Neo Granzon instead of a regular Granzon.
