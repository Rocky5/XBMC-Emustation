SO HERE'S THE SCOOP...

Something devastating is about to happen: the world is about to be unified under one oppressive governing body - The New Order Nation - a corrupt alliance of government and big business, set on crushing today's youth and destroying anything that's at all fun. It's a gruesome regime, held under the iron rule of Headmistress Helga, a vicious vamp whose obvious attractions are truly fatal, and enforced by battalions of evil, leather-clad troops.

As the story unfolds, you learn that America's premier rock band, Aerosmith, have been abducted from the hottest club in Los Angeles, Club X, by NON forces, and that this is just the beginning. Their message is clear: the party's over. It's now up to you. You're the only one who can stop the destruction; and music is your weapon.

Surrounded be enemy helicopters and armored personnel carriers brimming with psychotic New Order storm troopers wielding some rally wicked weaponry, it's gonna take a lot of shooting to fight your way out of this one.

Take aim with your sonic assault weapon - the auto-load multi-CD launcher - and blast the @#!* out of these treacherous tyrants to restore life as we know it.

It's a roller-coaster ride through some extremely tough scenarios as you uncover what's really going on at the Evergreen Chemical Company in the heart of the Amazon Jungle, battle to stop the bus that's taking people to Brainwash Central to reorient them for the new society, and conquer Kemmitech where they're making mind-altering drugs. All must be destroyed while you search for Aerosmith and help to set them free for a celebratory concert at London's Wembley Stadium.

There are hidden obstacles at every turn. Skeletons in every closet. Whatever you do, don't give up.
