Eris goes in a bit of a different direction than the other hacks. It uses all new graphics and some crazy room design to make a very eerie, moody, and atmospheric hack. There are debilitated statues and dead trees everywhere and honestly it can feel like a Castlevania game at times. The music is hand picked for every environment (rather than most hacks where it's Norfair music for Norfair, Brinstar music for Brinstar, etc) which goes a long way towards enhancing the ambiance. The good thing about Eris is that its difficulty comes from slightly beefed up baddies rather than hard-to-traverse rooms. This streamlines exploration and makes for less headaches. Eris is a very well-done hack with some excellent, scary level design and a nice sense of progression.
