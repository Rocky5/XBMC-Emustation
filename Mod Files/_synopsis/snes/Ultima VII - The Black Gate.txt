At the dawning of the Age of Enlightenment, a movement called the Fellowship becomes the leading philosophical and moral ideology of the lands of Britannia. As the people embrace this new vision of a better world, they believe that disasters requiring the aid of the Avatar will be a thing of the past, and the Avatar himself and all his struggles will fade into legend. However, a mysterious figure known only as the Guardian threatens to force Britannia under his will, and the Avatar must once again return to the land, to find the source of these new disruptions.
