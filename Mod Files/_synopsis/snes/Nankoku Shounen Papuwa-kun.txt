Awesome awesome game. Apparently it's based on some kind of manga that was really hot in Japan at the time. You know Enix, they love them manga-to-game adaptations. And they don't suck like Banpresto's! Hahaha! Ow! OW! Hey stop that!

So anyways Papuwa's this guy, you know? And the game he's in is this side-scroller. And you run around hitting things. I'm not sure why, cause the intro's not translated. Dof! But hey! There are karakasas in the game! Of Azumanga Daioh fame. As soon as I saw it, I thought "Hey, I remember Osaka in an outfit that looked just like that." And that's my karakasa story.

Translation Description:

THIS GAME RULES. Play it. Okay, now the important stuff. Lots of stuff has been done, and lots of stuff hasn't, such as the opening and any graphical text. And the credits, but I'll be damned if I can get that far. I suck at this game. Anyway, hopefully F.H. can tidy up the rest of it, because, well, the game rules. Thanks to Karin Aoi, Unicorn23/Rom, David Mullen, Dark Force, and F.H. for a translation I've been eagerly expecting for a long long time. Hurray!
