Worms is a turn based artillery game, similar to other early games in the genre such as Scorched Earth. The game is set on a two-dimensional field. The players control a team of worms, each consisting of four members. The objective is to kill every member of the opposing team(s) within a set time limit per round. Each turn, which lasts from 45 to 100 seconds, a player may move a selected worm and use one or more of the available weapons and tools.

The weapons include simple firearms like the shotgun and uzi, alongside a variety of heavy weapons such as the bazooka (the default selection), cluster grenades and airstrikes. The game also includes a number of 'secret' weapons (available through cheat codes on options screens or 'weapon drops' during the game) such as the Banana Bomb and exploding sheep, for which the series has become famous.

Also available are various tools such as the 'drill', 'blowtorch' and 'girders' - often used to add protection, adding additional strategy elements. The 'ninja rope', 'bungee' and 'teleport' are also available for greater movement across the playing field.
