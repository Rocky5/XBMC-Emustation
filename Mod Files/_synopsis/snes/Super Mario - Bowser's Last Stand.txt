This is a really nice hack. I love how you started the game with assorted Super Mario Bros. retros. I thought it would have been cool if I could pick up those sprouts like in a Fake Mario 2. Nice lakitu boss and SMB3 lakitu. I'm wondering how I can make the SMB3 lakitu go away. And it would be nice if you used that custom block from STARSW.zip for the flagpole (SMB Goal Pole and Goal Block with Music (Acts like 130)). This is really short, too. Anyway, good job!
