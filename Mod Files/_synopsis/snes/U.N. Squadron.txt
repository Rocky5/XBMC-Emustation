_________________________
The game is a typical side scrolling shooter, going against the trend of other Capcom shooters, such as 1942, and 1943: The Battle of Midway, which are vertically scrolling shooters. However, like other Capcom shooters, the player has a life / energy bar that is consumed over the course of a single life as the player sustains damage. A trait highly uncommon among other comparable arcade style shooters which normally use a system of reserve lives, where one of which is lost upon a single enemy hit.

The player can choose between three mercenary pilots: Shin Kazama, Mickey Simon, and Greg Gates. Each pilot flies a specific plane and has slightly different capabilities.

Tips:

Gamer Mode
At the options menu, highlight Game Level with controller one and hold X and A on controller two.  Press Right twice on controller one. Exit the menu, and enjoy.
