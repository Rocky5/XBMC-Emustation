Well, what can I say about this game? Well, for starters, it's the sequel to classic(!?) NES game, Renegade. Now, before you start running, let me say that it's waaaaaaaaaay cooler. For starters, the plot line is a lot more involved, there's no doors that take you back to the beginning of the game, and there's profanities all over the place. Yeah, I thought that would get your attention.

The game is kind of like West Side Story (or Deuce's Wild for the uncultured) meets Double Dragon.You play through the game as the "protectors" of two Japanese High Schools  Riki and Kunio (and eventually two other folks), and they've been thrown in jail for something they haven't done. Naturally, you have to break out of your cell, and you of course do this by beating the piss out of everyone that isn't you. You spend the rest of the game beating the answers to why you've been framed out of all the hoodlums you encounter. Add a motorcycle chase towards the end into the equation, and that's the gist of the game.

The game play is straight-forward (it has nothing that hasn't been done before in the first Double Dragon game), but it's still fun nonetheless.

Translation Description:

What's to say? This is the work of Gideon, and it should go without saying that everything is translated with no errors or glitches that I encountered. The language of the script is a little coarse, but given that it's a Kunio game, it's probably coarse in the Japanese version as well. Anyhow, another job well-done by Gideon.

Tips:

Password Cracks

The passwords in Kunio Tachi no Banka consist of Four digits. The first and third digits is the game's stage.  Here's the a list of all the passwords for each level. The second digit is used for the Bike Stages. In order to go to a Bike Stage, the first and third digit must be 0s, while the second digit must be one of the following numbers. The fourth and final digit is to determine the difficulty level. Even Numbers are for Normal Mode (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), while Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are for Easy Mode. This is quite meaningless if you try to go to any scene beyond the first conversation with Sabu, as the game will always be in Normal.
