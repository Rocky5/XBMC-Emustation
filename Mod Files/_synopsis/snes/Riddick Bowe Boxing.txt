Riddick Bowe Boxing features gameplay that was practically identical to that featured in Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing. The graphics are similar in function; however, they have been completely redrawn in a more cartoon-like style. As Evander Holyfield's Real Deal Boxing, the visuals of a fight are made up of 2D sprite-based boxers and a simple 3D boxing ring. A small overhead map of the ring featuring both fighters' positions is also visible during fights. The game features a career mode in which the player fights their way through all the boxers in the game until facing Bowe himself. The game also features an exhibition mode in which players can play as any boxer and put them in matches against any boxer in the game.

Using this as a navigation aid, it is possible to move boxers 360 degrees around the ring. However, due to all the boxers' sprites being drawn from one side-on point of view, their lateral movement appears somewhat unusual.

Tips:

Jump straight to the Championship Screen and credits  When the Ref holds your hand after winning a match, press and hold A, B, X, Y, L, R, and Select, then press Start
