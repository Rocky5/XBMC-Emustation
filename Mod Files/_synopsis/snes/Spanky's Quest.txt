_________________________
Spanky's Quest is a game, published in 1991 by Natsume, for the Super Nintendo. The main character is a monkey named Spanky who attacks by throwing different kinds of balls.

The game begins with a cutscene where a witch traps Spanky. Spanky attacks by throwing a small purple bubble. He can then bounce the bubble on his head. Every time he bounces the bubble, the bubble grows and changes color. The bubble can then be popped, depending the bubble's size and color, different types of sports balls will fly out of the bubble destroying enemies touched by the balls. For example, a purple bubble will release a baseball and the larges orange bubble will release several basketballs. If an enemy is touched by a bubble, he will simply be stunned and unable to move for a moment.

The enemies in the game are all different types of fruits mostly. The soundtrack is characterized by an upbeat jazz-like style of music with creative bass patterns.

Attacks:

The first time a bubble is thrown, it is purple. If it is popped, a baseball comes out and can usually only hit one enemy at a time. If a purple bubble is bounced on Spanky's head, it turns green. When the green bubble is popped, it creates a string of soccer balls that can usually take out a line of enemies. Bouncing the green bubble creates a yellow bubble that, when popped, becomes a gyrating volleyball, causing damage to an area of increasing radius. Bouncing the bubble a fourth and last time, the largest bubble is reached. When this orange bubble is popped, it releases several basketballs that shower down on a wide range of enemies.
