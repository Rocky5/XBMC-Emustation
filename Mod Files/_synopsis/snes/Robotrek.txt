Space...

If you could travel the seemingly endless limits of space, you might just come across the planet Quintenix. A planet Earthlings may very well consider paradise. On Quintenix exists a small town called Rococo. The technology on Rococo is slightly more advanced then the technology we have here on Earth. The people of Rococo are warm and friendly, living in peace together.

Until now... A rogue band of pirates called the Hackers, invaded Rococo and began terrorizing it's citizens. The Hackers created Androids to help them wreak havoc on Rococo. The people of Rococo are terrified. They have no idea what the Hackers want.

There is a small boy who recently moved to Rococo. This particular boy dreams of becoming a great inventor like his father. He has come to Rococo to seek his fortune. Secretly he hopes to fulfill his dreams. Who are the Hackers? What do they want? You must find out!
