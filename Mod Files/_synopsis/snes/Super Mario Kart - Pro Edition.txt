Super Mario Kart makes its comeback!

This hack is a complete remake of SMK, featuring 20 new tracks. The AI also works, meaning you'll have to work for that first place in GP mode.

For when you're feeling more like hitting your friends with shells and bananas, there's also 4 new battle mode courses for you and your friends to determine who is the champion of battle once and for all.

If you played the original SMK and felt that you needed more of a challenge or wanted more to experience, then download this hack. You won't be disappointed.
