"not quite like being in the TV show, but still fun"

The storyline of Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Crossroads of Time is set in the first season of the TV show Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Players assume the character of Commander Benjamin Sisko for most of the game, but at certain points also play as other characters such as Major Kira Nerys, Dr. Julian Bashir, and Constable Odo. The graphics are 2D, side-scrolling, and the music is fairly good, although it can't compare to newer games with more advanced technology, it is still good. Players can walk around on the station Deep Space Nine and interact with many characters familiar to those who have seen the TV show. The characters's lines in the game fit their portrayal in the show, which adds to the atmosphere and gives a feeling that the player is acting out an episode of the show. However, the places on the station where one can actually go are quite limited. Fortunately, the game does not keep Sisko and crew on the station the whole time.

Some Bajoran terrorists are causing trouble on the station, which eventually leads to a fast-paced chase in a runabout (a type of small spaceship) through the wormhole into the Gamma Quadrant, and also to the planet Bajor. Players make use of many items and technology depicted in the TV show, such as phasers, tricorders, replicator, hypospray, PADD, and the computers of Federation starships. The gameplay can be very difficult at times, but passwords are given at certain points to keep track of progress. There are often time limits, such as for finding the bilitrium explosives planted by the terrorists at the beginning of the game; the game will end if the task is not completed in time. Also, Sisko can quite easily fall to his death in many areas, even on board the station, as the controls for jumping and grabbing hold of ledges is a bit awkward.

The handheld phaser is difficult to aim; it is often easier to hit things by just holding down the button when firing the phaser and sweeping it across the screen, rather than trying to aim at your target. The controls for flying the runabout are better, but the runabout has few features. Overall, the game was rather difficult, but still fun, although I did become very frustrated in several areas.
