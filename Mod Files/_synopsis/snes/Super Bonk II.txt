_________________________
Bonk originally appeared on the PC-Engine and was actually sort of the console's mascot character for a while. But then the console died, and poor Bonk had to look for other employment opportunities. So he got to star in two SNES Bonk games, the first of which was brought over to the US.

In this game, you guide Bonk through various levels, collecting items and beating bosses by using your head, and I don't mean thinking. You use a headbutt to beat up your enemies, or you jump and dive at them using your head.

Additionally, you can also grab meat, which makes Bonk change into other? personalities. I've got Pissed-Off Bonk and Femenine Bonk so far. And I wish I was joking in regards to that second one. The game's fairly simple, and easy to play. Just don't let it go to your head. Oh, I'm here all week folks, thank you!

Translation Description:

All the essential text has been hacked and translated in by Musashi. However, there were some compressed graphic text that he couldn't mess with, like the signs and stuff. Nothing big, and you can play the game without it. So go play!
