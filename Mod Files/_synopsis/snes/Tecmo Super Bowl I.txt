After the initial success of Tecmo Bowl, Tecmo followed up with the release of Tecmo Super Bowl in 1991. The original Tecmo Bowl was licensed by the National Football League Players Association, while NFL Football for NES managed to obtain only a team license. Tecmo Super Bowl added the NFL license making it the first NES game to feature both actual NFL teams and players of the time. Also unlike the original Tecmo Bowl, which had twelve teams, Tecmo Super Bowl features all 28 teams. In 1997, both Electronic Gaming Monthly and IGN, video game publications, named TSB one of the top 100 video games of all time.

Tecmo Super Bowl is still played today. There are national tournaments around the country. More info can be found on www.knobbe.org and www.tecmo.us . Tecmo Super bowl is also played online using Emulators and Roms. There are over 100 players online who participate in leagues, tournaments, and pick-up games. You can play with the original rosters, updated, past, college and many other rosters available. 

Gameplay and Features:

Every team in TSB was modeled after a real life NFL franchise. The teams used the same logos and the same city affiliations used by the NFL. As in real life, each team had its own offensive playbook, but unlike real life the defense must simply be chosen from the offensive team's plays in an attempt to anticipate specific plays (thus, there are no specific defensive plays or formations).

In the original NES Tecmo Bowl, each team had 20 players on its roster, with nine players for offense, nine players for defense, a kicker, and a punter. In Tecmo Super Bowl, each roster had 30 different players. Each team had eleven defensive players, which could not be substituted, nor injured. Each team had seventeen offensive players, which included eleven starters and six substitutes. At any given time, eleven players were on the field for each team, consistent with NFL rules. A kicker and a punter were also on the roster.[2][3]

In addition to using real teams and players, TSB incorporated the full-length 1991 NFL regular season schedule for the game. The playoff format, including the Super Bowl and the post-season Pro Bowl game, was also used.

Tecmo Super Bowl retained the arcade-style football gameplay of the original which included the ability to break tackles (many players had "94" hitting power ratings, giving them the ability break any non-sliding tackles). However, the game added new features, such as statistics tracking that included All-Time NFL season records, expanded and editable playbooks[4], the ability to substitute players, varying conditions of players, fumbles, and player injuries. As it had previously, the game used cutscenes for important events like touchdowns and halftime shows. Tecmo Super Bowl also added cutscenes when injuries or big plays occurred.

Tips:

Sound Test
Press the L and R buttons at the same time at the title screen.

Easy Defense
When you're on defense, select the nose tackle (the middle man on the defensive line) and hold down-right.  When the ball is snapped, press B as soon as possible and you will shoot across the line and tackle the QB/RB (whomever has the ball). This doesn't work for every offensive play, but will work the vast majority of the time.
