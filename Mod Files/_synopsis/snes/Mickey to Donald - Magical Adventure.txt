_________________________
Mickey and Donald - Magical Adventure 3 is the third series in the Disney-inspired platormers made by Capcom in the 1990's. The game plays just like The Magical Quest and The Great Circus Mystery: Go through levels, gain new costumes that empower you with new skills, repeat.

The game begins with Mickey and Donald playing with Huey, Louie and Dewey, but the three kids piss off Donald, which makes them run away in fear. They hide in the attic, where they find a book which absorbs them. Rather, King Pete decides to kidnap them and make them his slaves. Some imagery. Once Mickey and Donald find out about this, a fairy shows up and sends them into the book to find the nephews and stop King Pete.

The game is pretty damn good, the graphics and music are awesome, too. And you can choose between Mickey or Donald, which is fun if you prefer one over the other. The only bad thing is that Mickey gets the best gear, while Donald gets the crappy stuff. For example, Mickey gets some awesome armor. What does Donald get? A wooden barrel, a bucket, and a wooden hammer. Poor, poor Donald. I didn't play through the entire game, but you can get an armor, some tree-climbing equipment (which is similar to the mountain climbing gear you get in part two), and a magic lamp. Weird. But fun. The game might be a bit easy for some folks, though. But it's still pretty fun to seek out all hidden life containers and bonus games in there.

Translation Description:

The version 1.1 patch still translates everything, and it fixes some grammar and contextual errors. The game is translated into British English, so be on the lookout for favours and armours as you play the game. I'm sure you won't mind. I didn't.
