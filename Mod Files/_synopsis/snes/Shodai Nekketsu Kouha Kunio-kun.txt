_________________________
Some people call this game River City Ransom 2. It's by the same people, and it's the same type of game. So I can see why. The only problem is that what I've played of it is helluva less fun than the original River City Ransom. The premise is the same as every other brawling game out there. You walk around the streets, subways, buildings and what have you and beat up everyone that isn't you. Simple, yet effective.

The graphics in this are obviously better than the original RCR, being for the SNES and all? but they took out the shopping part of the game. Collecting money and buying stuff was one of the cool things with RCR? It's just not the same without shops. However, the game is still packed with all the corny dialog you can shake a stick at. If that's your thing, this game is sure to amuse you for at least a few hours.

Translation Description:

Shodai Nekketsu Kouha is often misnomered as River City Ransom 2, but that?s not quite right. Kunio and Riki actually gain experience, RPG-style, as well as equip weapons and use items that their enemies drop, learning new moves and special skills, but there?s no money - so you can?t buy anything. That said, there?s a day/night cycle implemented into the game, and certain places are only open at certain times of the day. You can also play some minigames to earn some extra items!

The story involves Kunio?s gang from Nekketsu High being invited to a vacation in Osaka by an exchange student. On his way to the hotel, however, Kunio is ambushed by thugs! He quickly learns of the Osaka Student Union, a gang of highschoolers intent on taking over Japan! This obviously won?t do, so gut-punching ensues!

It?s pretty much done! Hooray!
