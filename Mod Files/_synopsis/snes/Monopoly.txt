_________________________
Do not pass go, do not collect $200. How many of us have heard these words while playing the classic board game? Well, the wonderful game of getting money is now a similarly classic video game. Choose from your favorite game pieces to run around the board and collect property, all the while trying to bankrupt the other players.

Monopoly is a fun game that will have you playing for hours. The graphics of this game are good, with a cartoonish feel to them except for an almost realistic hand that rolls the dice. The music is good, but mostly during gameplay there is no music. All in all this is a fun game that brings in all the aspects of the classic board game.

Directions:

Monopoly is almost exactly like the board game it is modeled after. You choose your game piece and the number of opponents. Now you're ready to play. Roll the dice and traverse the board, which is just like the actual game-board from the board game, collecting property, paying taxes, and getting Chance and Community Chest cards. From the game menu you have the option to buy and sell houses and hotels, mortgage and unmortgage property, and trade with the other players. During normal gameplay you can push the "Y" button to view what properties have been bought already and by whom. Get money and bankrupt the other players in this game of high-stakes business. Have fun!

Controls:

A Button - ROLL / ACTION
B Button - CANCEL BUTTON
