16 of the worlds best soccer teams have come together to have a tournament! Take control of one of the teams and burst your way through big, bad soccer players!

I'm not much of a soccer fan, but this game had me glued to my seat. It's one hard game. And when I say hard, I mean "Sit down and do this math test" hard. But there's a lot of cool stuff besides the tournament. Like shootout mode and a cool intro animation. 

Directions:

The object is to use your team to kick a ball around and get it into your opponent's net. your opponent is trying to do the same to you. The person who scores the most points wins. If there's a tie, a shootout happens. 5 shots go. If the score is tied after the balls have been shot, it keeps going until the score evens out.

Controls:

A Button - Passes, cancels
B Button - Selects, shoots
X Button - Nothing
Y Button - Checks
L Button - Nothing
R Button - Nothing
Start Button - Starts game
Select Button - Pauses Game
