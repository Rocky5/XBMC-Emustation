_________________________
This is the classic color-matching puzzle game, much like Puyo Puyo or Bust-A-Move if you've played those. Except this game is kind-of backwards. The blocks are already there, you have to rearrange them so that there's at least three of the same color vertically adjacent to eachother. Doing that makes them disappear, and makes your opponent's stack increase in size. Oh, yeah, there's a CPU-controlled opponent. And of course when he matches up blocks, YOUR stack grows. Unfortunatley, the CPU is way better than I am at this. So, um, yeah.

It seems that everything is translated in this, which must not have been a super-duper feat since the only text is the menus and the intro. :-)
