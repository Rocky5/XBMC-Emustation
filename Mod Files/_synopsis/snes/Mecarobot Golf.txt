A robot named Eagle is blocked from participating in the world's professional golfing tournaments due to ignorance. Eagle has the ability to play golf better than a human being but is denied the chance to do so. A benefactor purchases Eagle and builds a golf course for him to practice on. The player's skill determine whether humans or robots are truly better at golf. Various modes (lesson, driving range, competition) helps the player practice his abilities that he will need in future matches.

It is possible to save a game while in the middle of a golfing session. Through practice and the driving range, duffers can improve their maximum yardage, their handicap, and eventually get promoted from duffer status. "Semi-pro" and "pro" levels are considered to be the two highest levels a video game golfer can receive in this video game.

Emergency lessons offer advice when a player is about to perform a mistake in the practice (learning) mode of the game; the player only needs to hit the X button to activate the lesson. After the 13th hole, the players must use a small boat to get to the 14th hole regardless of what mode the player is using. Like most Super NES golfing games, the clubs are selected automatically for the player, and he must aim the ball and strike it with accuracy and balance. Players get to choose between four sets of golf clubs. The ones with the bunnies on them are considered to be beginners' golf equipment; they don't give off very good yardage and the starting handicap is 36. As the player plays in various months of the year, the golf course changes. Winter offers completely faded grass while summer brings out the most amount of colors in this video game.

In the Japanese version, an all-male group of Japanese golfers replaces the character's family members due to cultural and ethnic reasons. While the Japanese golfers were of Asian background, the "family members" in the North American version are shown to be Caucasian.
