_________________________
Batman: Revenge of the Joker, also known as "really crappy Batman" was going to be released by Sunsoft in 1992. The company that developed it was Icom Simulations. It was released on the Genesis and NES, but was likely not released on the snes because it was too bad. The thing that gets me is that the enemy patterns have a distinct behavior that reminds me of Total Recall for the NES. The rom of the game is floating around should you feel the need to play this.
