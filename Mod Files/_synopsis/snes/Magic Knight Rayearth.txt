I played this a little when the translation first came out. Now that I have to play it again for this review, I remember why I stopped.

If you people know anything, you'll know that Magic Knight Rayearth is a popular manga/anime series in Japan, and also here, sort of. Most people say it's a bad game, because they all say it's "too easy" or "too short." This is, of course, all coming from people who have never seen the MKR anime or manga. The game follows the manga's plot pretty much from beginning to end (I assume), so seeing the anime/manga isn't exactly a prerequisite. But if you haven't, then it'll just be some short easy RPG for you. The reason I don't like it is that the battles are painfully slow. It just gets annoying after a while, OK?

For those who are wondering, "Hey, is this anything like the Saturn version of Rayearth?" the answer is, "No, not in the slightest." The Saturn version r0x though.

Translation Description:

Note the file MKRHARD.IPS in the zip file. This modifies the way that HP is gained when you go up a level. I haven't tried it myself, but I assume that the only thing that changes is the game's difficulty.
