_________________________
Madden NFL '95 was the first Madden to showcase no passing windows. Previously included "Past Championship Teams" and "All-Franchise" teams were not included. This is the first Madden game to save season mode via a cartridge battery. Player stats were tracked individually both in-game, and throughout a season. The cover has John Madden on it, but it also features two generic players on it.

It is the first to be released to a handheld, being released for the first time to both the Game Boy and Game Gear.

Tips:

Expansion Teams
Before beginning a new game, go to the Game Setup Screen and highlight either the Home or Visiting Team Options.
Press L, R, L, R, A to play as the Jaguars or press L, R, L, R, Y to play as the Panthers

One minute game time
In exhibition mode, go to game length, and hit L, R, L, R, X. You should get one minute game time.

69 Bears
To Play with the 69 Bears and little Walter press YYXY at the team select

Easily block punts
When the computer is forced to punt, select the 'Punt Rush' formation, then take control of your fastest player and line him up on the left side of the field, just outside the leftmost offensive lineman.  Remember to use the line of scrimmage glitch to your advantage and move him down a little bit.  When the ball is snapped, you'll easily be able to use your superior speed to charge in and block the punt due to the running back in the punt formation never moving over to assist in the blocking scheme. It should be noted that while this glitch is practically identical to the glitch seen in Madden '94, you need to be much faster this time around to pull it off correctly.

Easy defense
Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but
a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 95 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place.  When the ball is snapped, you'll have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.

Guaranteed Two Point Conversions
After scoring a touchdown, you can use a very simple glitch to guarantee yourself an extra two points.  Select Goal Line Halfback Lead Left.  The AI will always come out with their Field Goal block team and call an audible. Snap the ball while they're running around like idiots changing their defense around and you'll have a free path to the end
zone every single time.
