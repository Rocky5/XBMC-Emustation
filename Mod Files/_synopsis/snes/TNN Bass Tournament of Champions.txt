_________________________
The object of the game is to catch as much large bass as possible so that the player can advance through the tournaments and eventually win the championship. The player has from sunrise to sunset to fish, thus giving him the necessary time to develop strategies related to participating in a virtual fishing derby. Changes in the season and the weather will try to impede the player's progress as he attempts to win the championship.

Other fish (besides bass) can be accidentally caught as well, but they will not count towards the final score. Only bass will count towards the player's progression throughout the game. During the 1990s, this game attracted rural and suburban teenagers (who usually ignored The Nashville Network's more bucolic-oriented shows like The Real McCoys and the Grand Ole Opry).
