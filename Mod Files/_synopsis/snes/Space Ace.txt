"Space Ace goes where no man wants to go...straight down the toilet!"

While playing this game, I ran into a few snags, and decided to seek help on the internet. After all, information for just about everything from mountain climbing to "at home bikini waxes using old Christmas candles" can be found on the net, right? Well, why couldn't I find any information about it anywhere on the entire web? Am I the only one who's ever played this awful game??!! Well, if I am, 'tis a far better thing that I suffer alone than that the rest of the world suffer with me. My only hope is that those of you who are reading this might not yet have suffered through this game, and might heed my advice and ignore the semi-okay screen shots you might have seen of this game. THIS GAME SUCKS EGGS!

Er?nothing to see?or hear, rather?here. The music in this game is passable, but the sound effects reek. They're the same old, run of the mill, corny space game sounds, and they sound canned and unimpressive. I think maybe some of them were abducted from the laserdisc sounds where they were more at home, probed then stripped for parts, then stuffed into this cartridge. The annoying sounds and monotonous music will join the effort to drive you nuts and make you sick of this game faster than the speed of light.

Sorry, Ace?your game sucks. This is the second Don Bluth laserdisc game that was popular in the arcade and stuffed into the action/adventure format in a SNES cartridge. Well, Dragon's Lair managed to survive the translation with a few flaws, but some remaining playability. Space Ace, however, didn't survive the transition, and what we're left with is it's rotting corpse, stuffed into some semi-attractive retail packaging, and waiting to stink up the likes of your SNES system. This ones an Ace in the hole?the black hole of video games we wish were never made. Forget about it.
