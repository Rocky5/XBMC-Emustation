THE JOURNAL OF DR. CAIN

April 10th

I can't believe what I found! Several meters below the surface was the remains of a lab. Although most of the lab was damaged, I did manage to find papers that indicate that it belonged to the famous robot designer, Dr. Thomas Light. I've begun to review what is left of Dr. Light's notes and it looks like he was onto a major breakthrough.

April 14th

Today I met "Mega Man X". Not simply a robot, Mega Man X is something totally different. Light has given him the ability to think and make his own decisions. At times, Mega Man X seems more like a man than like a machine.

November 22nd

With Mega Man X's help I have completed my first "Reploid". Although I don't completely understand how all of Dr. Light's systems work, I was able to make some minor modifications and the Reploid seems to be functioning perfectly. His strength and intelligence seem limitless and he is fully able to make his own decisions. In fact, we got into our first argument. How intriguing!

January 3rd

The new reploids have been running off the assembly line for several weeks. It's amazing how easily they have been able to adapt to even the most difficult jobs. It still is a bit odd to see them working side by side with humans, but everyone seems to be happy to accept them.

February 16th

Three reploids went "maverick" today and injured two people before they were stopped. This is the third instance of this type of behavior and I still have no idea what is causing it! There is some talk about stopping the assembly of any more reploids, but I don't think it will happen. Maybe we've become too dependent on them....

The council has now decided to set up a group of "Hunters" to destroy any maverick before it can cause injury. The reploid named Sigma has been assigned to lead the Hunters. Sigma is one of the most intelligent reploids I've created and contains my latest circuit designs. His systems should be immune to any problems.

June 4th

My worst nightmare has just come true. Sigma went maverick today and took most of the other hunters with him. His motives are unclear, but it seems that he "decided" that humans are inferior and limiting the growth of the Reploids. For that reason, he decided that all humans should be eradicated.

Most of the population is in hiding or trying to flee the city. I'm not sure how long we can hold out against Sigma's forces. I fear I have built the Reploids too well.

Mega Man X is taking the news of the war very personally. He wants to join ZERO, the new leader of the Maverick Hunters, when he goes after Sigma. I'm doubtful of their chances, but I won't stop him. Something has to be done....

--From the SNES Mega Man X instruction manual.

Overview:

This was one of the best games ever made for the SNES. Mega Man X took full advantage of the capabilities of the SNES in the realms of graphics, playability, sound, and controls. It was very simple to play, yet hard to master. Like most Mega Man games there were plenty of secrets to find and lots of weapons to gain (from the sub-bosses of course).

This was also the first game that had Zero. Zero is another robot based on Mega Man X's design who helps in certain parts of the game. Any Mega Man fan should certainly play this game in the series along with Mega man X 2 &amp; 3. 

Directions:

Like most Mega Man games you must lead Mega Man through many sub boss levels in order to get to the head boss. In Mega Man X it is no different.

To have all Turbo Hearts, all Sub-Tanks, and  all Armor Upgrades with no bosses defeated

Zero's Buster
This is done by not getting the arm Power up in Flame mamoth's stage, Go to Sigma stage 1 and when Zero will die he will give you his buster.

Subtank Glitch
Get three sub-tanks and make sure one of your special weapons has less than full power. Then, with the weapon
that has less than full power selected, grab a weapon capsule and immediately hit start. If you did it right, you'll have a fourth sub-tank. Fill it using the same method, just don't over fill or you'll delete it and your third one. It recovers health just like the a normal one.

Mega Man Fireball
Must have Heart Tanks, Sub-Tanks, enemy weapons, and power-ups. Then, go to Armored Armadillo's level. Reach
the final mine cart, which launches you through the air at the end of the level. Just before you reach the wall, jump up and climb the wall. At the top, there will be a large Energy Unit. Get it, and then jump into the pit and die. Repeat this step five times.  On the fifth time through, a capsule will appear on that same ledge. Dr. Light will then give you a Ryu-style fireball for Mega Man to use.

Stage Secrets
Some stages are a little different if you beat a certain boss first. If you beat Chill Penguin, the Lava in Flame Mammoth's stage will be frozen. If you beat Storm Eagle, the lights in Spark Mandrill's stage will flicker on and off. If you beat Launch Octopus, Sting Chameleon's stage will be partially flooded.

Stronger normal shots
Dash while firing your uncharged X-Buster to cause the shot to deal double damage. This is useful when you don't have time to wait for a shot to charge.
