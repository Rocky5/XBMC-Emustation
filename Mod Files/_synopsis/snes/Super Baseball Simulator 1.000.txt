Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 (Super Ultra Baseball in Japan) is a 1991 Super NES baseball game by Culture Brain that is the sequel to the NES game Baseball Simulator 1.000. In the game, there are 3 leagues: Atlantic, Northern, and Ultra. Each league has 6 teams. In the Ultra League, pitchers and batters have special power-ups that boost their abilities which gives the game a surrealistic feel that is rare in the sports genre. Players can even create their own baseball teams and assign special moves to the players that they name themselves. The game can be played in exhibition mode and season mode.
