This hack is NOT a skill based hack, hell, its not even a hard hack, its aimed at those of you have beaten Super Metroid, and want to play alittle more, but ALL those other hacks are to hard;) That being said, theres still plenty of tricky puzzles for you experts, so give this a go either way, you will not be dissapointed.  

Thanks for playing, good luck, and MOST importantly, have fun!;)

SKILLS NEEDED: Walljumping, Mid-air morphball (w/ bombing)

MISC: There are no savestations except your ship, so that means using Savestates.  I'm sorry if you don't like using them, there is a very good reason for not having them.
