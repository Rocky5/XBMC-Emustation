The plot for the game is a twist on the usual "Save the world" stereotype for many platform games. One evening, Taz's father is telling an intriguing tale. Somewhere on Tazmania is a Lost Valley, and in that valley nests a huge seabird, so huge that one of its eggs could feed a family for a year. Taz becomes fascinated by the prospect of the potentially large omelette and leaves in search of one of those eggs. However in his haste he leaves before his Dad has finished the story and thus does not know exactly where to go. The player must direct Taz through 5 stages in search of the Lost Valley and its Giant Bird.
