_________________________
Monstania is one of those kick-ass games that never got translated. I seriously don't see what the powers that be had against this game, except maybe it's short length. The graphics are impressive, the sound is great (with music by Lunar and Grandia god Noriyuki Iwadare), the story is pretty entertaining, and the gameplay is certainly there.

Anyway, the game revolves around young Fron, who with the help of his sweetheart, Tia, is in search of the whereabouts of the thought-to-be-extinct fairies. You pretty much sit back and enjoy the story as it unfolds, until you encounter the enemy, where you fight them in a semi-realtime strategy environment (i.e., the monsters only attack while you move). In many ways, the battle system is somewhat similar to Azure Dream's battle system for PSX.

Translation Description:

This is a superb translation of a superb game, and it comes highly recommended.
