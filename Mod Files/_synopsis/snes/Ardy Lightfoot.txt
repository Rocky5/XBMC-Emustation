The story of the game is that the sacred rainbow has shattered into seven pieces and it's up to Ardy to obtain them all again. Whoever collects all seven pieces will receive one wish. An evil king named Visconti has already gotten one piece and is searching for the others. To this end he sends out various creatures and henchmen such as Beecroft, Catry and others. These creatures form the opponents for Ardy during the game. Ardy is assisted by friends along the way like the elder (unknown name), Nina, and a mysterious adventurer named Don Jacoby.

Changes in the North American Version:

When Titus published Ardy Lightfoot for North American audiences, several changes were introduced. These included numerous sprites, such as Ardy's "waiting" pose, being removed; tied up and crying animals being removed from the background on the forest level; and in level 6, "Eaten!", Catry's "pile of bones" sprite because of death by acid was replaced with a sprite of her lying on the ground as well the acid drip being removed from the ceiling.
