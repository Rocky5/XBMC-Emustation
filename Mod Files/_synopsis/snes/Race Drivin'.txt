Race Drivin' is a sequel to the arcade driving simulator Hard Drivin'. Game play is similar to the first game. The player must complete laps around the race track before a timer expires. There are several checkpoints around the track which increase player's time as he passes.

Race Drivin' has three courses, one of which is the track from Hard Drivin'. There is a new super-stunt track, and an autocross course. The player also may choose from three types of cars.
