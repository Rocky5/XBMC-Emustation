MustadioBananas on the Gamefaqs.com board says: "It's about bananas, and chinese pirates looking for kung fu butt kicking treasure, Mes amis. ^_^"

That sounds AWESOME!!!!

Kayube later says this though: "It's a puzzle game... my mom used to play it a lot on the computer."

Boring!  And Mom liked it.... Double Boring!

Sadly, I've played Shanghai before on a few other platforms and I can tell you with 99% certainty that there are no actual Chinese flying kung-fu monkey pirates in search of golden banannas to be seen here.

And your mom told me she liked this game too.
