This patch may not look like much. In fact, it isn't much. But there-in lies the beauty of the patch! Rather than changing a vast many graphic or removing the backgrounds, the author decided to instead simply change some minor things here and there. The patch does exactly what it sets out to do: return Super Mario Bros. in Super Mario All-Stars to its roots by altering many graphics that were changed in the transition from the NES to the Super NES back to their original NES ones, though much prettier. If the grass in World 1-1 or the strange bricks in the world castles bugged you as much as it did Deespence2929  and I know it bugged me!  then this patch is for you!

Translation Description:

Since I was sick of seeing grass in world 1-1 where bricks should be I put together a hack to change several of the graphics of SMB1 in Super Mario All-Stars. It changes them to graphics which are much closer to what they were in the 8-bit game. The backgrounds have not been touched. The ROM needs to be unheadered.

Note that since Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels shares graphics with SMB that game will be affected as well. This game has not been tested to see if the changes remain throughout the game.
