MISSION STATUS The World Government intended that the fact-finding mission to Galaxy X1X be kept under wraps; yet information gathered from the mission had later leaked to the press and confirmed the public's most dreaded suspicions; extra-terrestrial mutants from the BYDO Empire were indeed consolidating their forces and soon would be departing their space bases to launch an all-out attack on the Earth. It's up to you now in your R-TYPE Spaceship to stop this threat.

-- from the SNES R-Type Manual

Directions:

Your ship starts out very vulnerable, one hit from anything and BOOM! You're gone. You lose all the power-ups you've gained so far so dying will really set you back in this game.

Press the B button to charge your weapon, or press X/Y to fire rapidly.

The key to this game are the Force Pods. The Force Pods amplify your power and ability, they will get you through this game. Collect the lettered icons around the stages to summon or upgrade a forcepod. A forcepod has three uses.

Ram - Attach the pod to the front of your ship and just run it into weaker enemies to kill them.

Backup Gunner - Press L or A to launch the force pod. Now whenever you fire, the force pod will also fire a blast. The more upgrades you get the better it's fire will cover you.

Rear Gunner - Attach the force pod to the back of the ship. Now when you press the fire button the pod on the back will fire as well, giving cover from behind. 

Controls:

A Button - Launch/Pull Force Pod
B Button - Fire/Hold to Charge
X Button - Rapid Fire
Y Button - Rapid Fire
L Button - Nothing
R Button - Launch/Pull Force Pod
Start Button - Pause

Music Remixes
To hear remixes of the game's music, go to the BGM Test (Background Music Test), play any track, and press R to
make the music fade out. While it's fading, continue pressing R as you hear musical tones played consecutively.  Eventually, you'll hear a remixed version of your favorite tune.
