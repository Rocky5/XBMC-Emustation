CHAOS AT THE SOCCER STADIUM

In the near future the day had come for the big showdown between the two best soccer teams in the nation. A wide television audience was expected in addition to the large crowd that had already assembled at the stadium.

As the teams took the field an uneasy feeling fell over the crowd. Suddenly, bursts of fire pelted the stadium and the field was engulfed in smoke. The crowd gazed in amazement as the smoke cleared to reveal that the players had been replaced by highly familiar robots running out onto the field. It seemed the robots were going to play the game instead.

The television audience was especially surprised at the events. The most surprised person was the one and only Dr. Light, who immediately recognized the robots and knew Dr. Wily had to be up to his old tricks. This is unexpected, Dr. Light thought. That's probably what Dr. Wily is thinking: no one will notice when my robots take control of the world through its most popular sport. Think again Dr. Wily, here comes MEGA MAN!

Dr. Light brought to life a reserve of blue crime-fighting robots with the trusty Mega Man leading them. The next great robot showdown will be on the soccer field. No matter where Dr. Wily's diabolical plots occur Mega Man will be there to battle through the robots and get Dr. Wily.
