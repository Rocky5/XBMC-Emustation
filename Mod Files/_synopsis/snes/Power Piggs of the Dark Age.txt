Power Piggs of the Dark Age is a side-scrolling action Super NES game that takes place during the Dark Ages. As a group of humanoid pigs, the object is to defeat a warlord who happens to be a humanoid wolf. Each of the Power Piggs uses his own medieval weapon and uses it to defeat minor enemies that lie in his path. The first stage is a typical medieval town but it only gets more surreal from there. Doughnuts are seen as food in the game for the main characters (as it is depicted in the title screen logo).
