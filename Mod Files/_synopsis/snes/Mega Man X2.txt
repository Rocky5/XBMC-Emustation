Reploid Elimination Not Completed

by Bradbury K. Wells

Times Staff Writer

A new uprising is imminent in the battle to contain the Maverick Reploids that have broken away from their control center. Once believed to be completely contained, these Mavericks have been detected in an abandoned production factory, according to an intelligence report by well-known scientist Dr. Cain.

A special armada of Mavericks Hunters was mobilized today to the production factory, but only one reploid has been able to penetrate the heavy artillery outside the factory.

Known as Mega Man X, this same reploid had been primarily responsible for the apparent elimination of the threat six months ago. According to Dr. Cain's report, now Mega Man X will battle the Mavericks in an attempt to locate and destroy the leader of this new uprising."

--From the SNES Mega Man X 2 instruction manual.

Overview:

This was one of our favorite Mega Man games. The graphics and the gameplay are great as always. Mega Man X 2 was a very popular game in its day but it was still a little tough for CC to find. I think we got lucky and found it at a flea market though. Capcom really knew what they were doing when they made this great title. If you have been living under a rock for the last ten years and somehow managed not to play Mega Man X 2, I suggest you come out from there and give it a try. 

Directions:

Classic Mega Man action! If you've never played a Mega Man game before, I'll give you a bit of a rundown. You must use your weapons to destroy the enemies, especially your main weapon, the Mega Buster, which you can charge up by holding down the shooting button. You'll eventually fight a boss, so you must use different battle strategies to overcome all! You can collect powerups, such as the ones that restore lost energy. Have fun!

Controls:

A Button - Dash
B Button - Jump
Y Button - Shoot
L Button - Quick Change Weapon
R Button - Quick Change Weapon
Start Button - Pause/Unpause, show menu

Ken's Shoryuken!
Megaman can use Ken's Shoryuken if you get all of the energy tanks, all of the hearts, and all of X's parts.  The capsule for the shoryuken is in the third x-hunter stage (Agile). At one point in his stage, there is a ladder with many bats around. Use the Crystal Hunter to crystallize a bat to reach the ladder.  Follow the path until you reach a downward path. Scroll on the left side of the path until X discovers a passage. You must be at full power for the capsule to appear. Dr. Light will give you Ken's Shoryuken

Disappearing Enemies
This will work with almost any enemy that can be frozen with the Crystal Hunter. Freeze the enemy with a normal shot then pause the game. Now at the pause menu select the X. Buster and hit start. The enemy that was frozen will no longer be there.

Harmless Sigma/Red X-Buster
To do this trick, you must have all of Zero's parts and the Flaming Dragon Punch. First, go to the last Sigma stage. Right before you enter the room where Sigma drops in, stop. Dragon Punch your way in and try to land where Zero will punch his hole after the dialogue. If done correctly, X will fall through the hole when Zero punches it out. When Zero starts talking, do not let his dialogue disappear. Leave it there until X lands in Sigma's room. When Sigma enters, make Zero's dialogue go away and X should be able to walk over to Sigma. Have X stand right by Sigma, and when Sigma begins to fill up his energy meter, Dragon Punch him.

When the fight begins, Sigma should not be able to harm you no matter what he does, making it easy for you to conserve you SubTanks and energy for the second battle. Also, this glitch makes your charged shots look a vibrant reddish-pink color.

It will stay this way until the second Sigma battle begins. Also, using the Giga Crush causes your X-Buster shots to go back to their original color.

Alternate ending screens of Zero
If you don't collect all of Zero's parts and beat the game. You will see a black-armored Zero at the 'Thanks for playing!' screen. But if you collect all of Zero's parts and beat the game, you will see the original Zero at the 'Thanks for playing!' screen instead.

Diagnostics Test
To see the Mega Man X2 diagnostic test, hold the B button on controller 2, then turn on your system. Keep holding until the test appears on screen.
