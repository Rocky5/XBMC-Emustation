_________________________
Banpresto League Soccer is basically what this is. You have your Ultraman team, and your Gundam team, and your Masked Rider team, and etc etc., and it's all very cartoony and SD and cutesy. I tried playing a game and it was really weird. Why was I playing as both teams? I think a manual of some kind is definitely in order.

Translation Description:

There's screens that come up before every match that say what world you're playing in, which are still in Japanese. Other than that, everything is translated. The font could be better though, but hey.
