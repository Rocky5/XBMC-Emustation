_________________________
Like many other games of its genre, the player takes the role of Mickey and progresses through each level, defeating enemies in the way and solving the occasional puzzle. Most enemies can be defeated by jumping on them or throwing marbles at them. Frequently, the player must jump from platform to platform to advance, sometimes with a time limit (such as escaping a collapsing tower).

Game History:

Originally, Mickey Mania was planned as a game to be released as part of Mickey's 65th birthday. However, as that would have only allowed 6 months to develop the game, this idea was soon scrapped in favor of the more compelling concept of Mickey travelling back to his original cartoons. It pays tribute to Mickey's career (and was released in 1994, the year after Mickey's 65th birthday).
