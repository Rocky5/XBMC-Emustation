Fire Dogs was more of a puzzle game than an action game as violence was few and far in-between and the goal was the sneak out of the fire station before time ran out. If time ran out or if the fireman caught the player, then he would lose a life. Nintendo Power once claimed that the time limit was too strict and the AI was not complex enough.
