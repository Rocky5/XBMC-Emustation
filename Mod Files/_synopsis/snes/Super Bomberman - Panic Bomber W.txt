_________________________
Super Bomberman: Panic Bomber World is a puzzle game based on the popular Bomberman series, which plays much like a cross between Bomberman and Puyo Puyo. Groups of blocks will fall from the top of the screen. Match three identical blocks and bombs will drop from the top of the screen. Occasionally, a lit bomb will fall and explode, setting off any bombs it hits and causing a chain reaction. The game is over when blocks fill the screen.

The game features a single-player story mode and a battle mode for up to four players.
