This game is full of action packed figh..... no, but is teeming with interesting storyli..... no, but it's got such awesome wea..... Well, ok, pretty much this is a game of putting together jigsaw puzzles, but it's still a fun game. Play against the computer or see if you're faster than your friends in 2 player vs mode.

Pieces is a fun game with cartoonish graphics (except for the almost realistic pictures on the puzzles you're building). The music in this game is good, but only plays during the Title and Menu screen and is replaced by interesting sound effects for the actual gameplay. This game is fun ad I recommend it for the puzzle fan.

Directions:

Pieces is fun and simple, just finish three puzzles before your opponent does. Play against a series of computer opponents that progressively get harder, or play against your friend to see who is better. You are timed, based on how quickly you get a piece in place. If you let the time run out, then you lose power. Your power lets you attack your opponents by slowing them down, removing pieces, or reversing their directional pad. Watch out though, they can do the same to you.

You also have aids that will tell you where a piece might go by telling you three possibilities, or it will tell you which way to go with the piece to give you some idea as to where it goes.

All in all, that's pretty much how the game is played. So sit down, Log in, and Have fun!
