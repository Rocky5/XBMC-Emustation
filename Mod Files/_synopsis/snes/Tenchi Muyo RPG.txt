_________________________
The Tenchi Muyo! English Translation Patch was created in 2000 by Lina`chan, Nuku-Nuku and Filia's Translations. The patch they released was riddled with bugs and missing some key elements. This game really needed some help, so nine years later, borderLine took it upon himself to address the problems in this addictive Strategy/RPG.

After two months of hacking another hacker's hack with no notes, inserting additional English text, redrawing all the Japanese graphics, and adding quite a bit of ASM, the 100% English Translation Patch final public release is available.
