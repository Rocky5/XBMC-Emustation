No doubt some of you are aware by now of the brand new Super Mario World Internet sensation sweeping the web; Super Mario World (Kaizo Edition). Not for the faint-hearted, this particular ROM hack appears to be developed by Satan himself, utilising some of SMW's most notorious enemies and obstacles in near-ridiculous situations to produce possibly the most insane 'game' ever created. It really has to be seen (and played) to be believed.
