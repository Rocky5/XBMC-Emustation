_________________________
This is the first in the long, varied series of Chunsoft's Mysterious Dungeon (or if you're a prude, Fushigi no Dungeon) series. All of the games in the series have one thing in common: lots and lots of dungeon crawling. I've never actually played Rogue, keep in mind, but it's hard to imagine this being anything different. You run around in a series of randomly generated dungeons, consisting of lots of rooms connected by small corridors. Randomly generated dungeons at their finest, here! And you fight monsters, and collect all manner of randomly generated treasure, and do it lots and lots of times.

This game involves Taloon (or Torneko, if you played its Playstation sequel, Torneko: The Last Hope (or the nonexistent English-language Dragon Warrior IV for Playstation)) leaving his home of Endor in search of fantastic treasures and whatnot. He eventually reaches the Mysterious Dungeon, and decides to poke around for a bit. And there you have it.

Translation Description:

This project started a long long time ago, with oRdErEDchaos and Wildbill. It changed hands a lot of times, over to Taskforce and then to necrosaro, and went through quite a lot of translation headaches, but the end result is pretty damn pleasant.

This is an unofficial release by necrosaro, and has not been approved by anyone at Magic Destiny, mostly cause no one knows where the hell they are. Wildbill wanted to hold off on a full release until everything was finished, most notably the intro text formatting and some graphics, but keep in mind the last patch release we saw from this was over three years ago. So necro wisely decided to just release it anyways.

All the horrible script formatting (or rather, lack of) has been fixed in this release, making it one hundred percent playable now. Like I said, the only problems are with the intro text, some graphics, and some other little things. Who cares! Go and play.

By the way, Wildbill's script edit is awesome.
