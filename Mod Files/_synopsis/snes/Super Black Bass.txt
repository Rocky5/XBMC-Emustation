Super Black Bass is the second game in the Black Bass series. The original was a lot of fun and this one is too. Super Black Bass added some pretty cool features. The graphics and sound were a lot better, and they added some new lures and a fish finder. I could spend all day playing this game trying to catch that ever elusive 12-15 pound bass. You will play through a series of tournements trying to get the highest weight in bass in order to place well in the tournement. What the bass will bite depends on the weather. If you push X, the game will give you some hints on what to fish with. Super Black Bass is a lot of fun, so if you are a fan of fishing, give this game a try!
