_________________________
The last Megaman game in the "true" Megaman series, this actually came after Megaman 8, and leans towards its slightly more realistic style, instead of the much more cartoony look that MM7 had. I mean seriously, compare the way Megaman looked in both games. Honestly, guys.

I haven't gotten into this game much, but my roommate has, and he tells me that Astroman is a total bastard. The cool thing about this game is that you can play as either Megaman or as Bass. Both have different characteristics, which makes playing each character a really different experience. Like, Megaman can charge his blaster, and Bass can fire in all (eight) directions. Pretty neat? Damn right it's neat.

Translation Description:

Aside from a minor graphic, everything is translated and very enjoyable. Fixing this graphic isn't really an issue, it's just that satsu is L-A-Z-Y. So la.

Guys, this is the translation you want to go with. Even the elusive CD Database is completely translated. There's even two different patches in the zip, depending on whether you prefer the Japanese or American naming conventions (ie. Rockman vs. Megaman, Blues vs. Protoman, Forte vs. Bass, etc.) Absolutely beautiful.

Speaking of different patches, use RMF-E.IPS if you want the Japanese names. Use MMB-E.IPS if you want the American names. Why Capcom always has to change the names I dunno, I always thought Biohazard was a cool name for a video game.

Tips:

Erase CDs Code
To erase the CDs that are in your data base highlight Continue on the start screen and press and hold the L, R, Select, and Start buttons until the screen changes and you hear a chime. You can now either choose to erase your CDs by pressing the Y button or choose to keep them by pressing the B button (you'll hear different chimes for each option).
