If you love to gamble but are intimidated by all the high-rollers and the bright lights of Las Vegas, then SUPER CAESARS PALACE is the perfect game for you. The essence of the world-famous casino has been beautifully translated for the Super Nintendo, offering nine different games. You can spend all day playing Video Poker, Blackjack, Slot Machines, Roulette, Craps, Keno, Red Dog, Horse Racing, and Scratchers. If you find yourself running low on cash, you can access any of the ATMs scattered throughout the vast casino. And if you are hanging out with Lady Luck, you may just find yourself in the VIP Room, where you'll rub shoulders with high-stakes gamblers and maybe even become one! You don't have to take out that second mortgage or sell your car to test your "foolproof" system in Vegas with SUPER CAESARS PALACE; you don't even have to leave the comfort of your own home!
