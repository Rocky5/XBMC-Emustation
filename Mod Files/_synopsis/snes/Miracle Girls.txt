_________________________
For God's sake, it's a platform game with two cute twins! How can you not love it? You know you do, dammit. So anyways you control one of these girls (the difference between them is not easily distinguished), and you walk to the right and you're cute. How do you defeat these creatures that block your path, you ask? You throw candy at them! And they eat the candy, and they eat contentedly, and that's your chance to slip by, as they chew merrily on the mysterious free candy! And then there's these platforms that plummet to the ground the second you step on them and you die and the end.

Translation Description:

It's done, and damn if it doesn't look good. Spot on work, as always!
