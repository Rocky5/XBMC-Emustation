Three children or teenagers competed in four athletic events at the "Extreme Arena" for points. First place in each event was worth 300 points. Second place received 200 points, and third place earned 100. Each contestant was dressed in one of three colors: blue, red, and purple.

Some events were based on skills in popular sports, such as basketball, baseball, football and soccer. Others made use of a wave pool, and sometimes a racing track was used. During the show's run, more creative and ambitious events were invented, including a fabricated ski slope and the famous "Peak to Peak." Each event was said to allow the contestants to "live out some of their greatest sports fantasies" in a competitive arena.

After the first event, one of the three players was asked to "Spill Your GUTS" between the remaining events. In season one, Mike talked about the player and his or her athletic and non-athletic interests. In season two, Moira discussed the player's interests, and also mentioned what GUTS equaled to that player. In season three, during a brief prerecorded segment, players introduced themselves and revealed their athletic and non-athletic interests, what "having guts" meant to them, why they were excited to be on the show, and/or usually also give a shout-out to their friends and family back home. On Global GUTS, contestants introduced themselves; non-English speakers introduced themselves in their native language, and a translator did an English voice over for them.
