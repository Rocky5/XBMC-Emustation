_________________________
Bart Simpson falls asleep while studying and wakes up in a strange universe where TVs and fairies roam the streets. The player must find Bart's lost homework and progress through the various levels to keep the homework pages and eventually return to reality.

The game is split in two parts. The first is set on a street (probably Evergreen Terrace, but referred to as Windy World). Bart walks around and has to find pages of his homework while avoiding enemies such as living post boxes and various characters from the show. Bart can collect his skateboard, which acts as a power-up and temporarily increases the player's speed. Jimbo and his gang would coerce Bart into strolling with them, to which Bart would lose control of his movements and have to move with them, even having to take damage. If Bart touched a flying saxophone, Lisa Simpson with pixie wings would sprinkle fairy dust on Jimbo and his gang and transform them into rats, freeing Bart. However, if Bart is by himself, the Lisa pixie would turn him into a frog, where the frog Bart could not attack. If Bart caught a kiss blown to him by an old lady, it would revert him to his human form. Bart would also have to use bubble gum to blow a bubble to repel enemies as well as collect floating Z's. 

An important trick would be to catch Z's at opposite ends of the game screen which served as "goal posts", thus extending the level of play in the game.

Principal Skinner occasionally appears and tries to dress Bart in his Sunday suit. If the player walks into Skinner, Bart will change appearance and become very slow and not be able to fire at enemies, however the suit will also protect Bart from all enemies and he will not take damage.

Tips:

Extra Lives in Itchy and Scratchy Game
Go to the lamp and get the weapon by it, then shoot the thing that the lamp throws out and they turn into lives. You can get 3 lives this way.

Skateboarding Bart
To get Bart to ride a skateboard, jump over a basketball in the main area. He can find papers faster this way.
