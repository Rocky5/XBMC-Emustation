Based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien, Frodo Baggins is a young man from the Shire who receives a "ring". He must bring it to Rivendell, where no evil force can touch it! So get ready for some great sword-fighting, mystical action!

Directions:

You'll start your quest alone, but along the way, you'll get companions to help, but they can die real easily, so be sure to hold those L or R buttons! There are many monsters to prevent Frodo from getting to Rivendell, but just keep trying! You'll be doing things like searching for an item or looking for a character or monster! By pushing L and R together at the same time, you get a password so you can return to a part of the game where you left off.
