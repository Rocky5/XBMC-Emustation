_________________________
General Fixes:

- Glitched map names (Gratze Kingdom, Capsule Monsters Cave)

- Glitched Submarine Shrine/Ancient Cave Final Floor maps

- Battle background for Shrine of Vengeance B2

- Music menu glitch (AKA the "Level 0" bug)

- Equip menu glitch (e.x. Tia has a Knife, Maxim has "no equip". Scroll from Maxim to Tia. Now, Tia suddenly has a Knifeuip equipped. What's fixed is that last part.)

Item Problems:

- Statue (Doesn't freeze/reset the game when used at the main menu)

- Sea ring (Makes attacks fire elemental.)

Enemy Problems:

- Mirror Check (Archfiend, Sphinx, Demise, Leech, Nosferato, and Sly Fox can use the Mirror spell effectively.)

- Nosferato's Contact (Nosferato now recovers HP when he uses Contact)

- Resistances and weaknesses of Copper Dragon and Ninja

- Dark Warrior's palette

- Bolt Fish lock up (No longer freezes the game when it runs out of MP)

- Frue Gades (You now fight the strongest version of Gades in Shuman Tower and Fortress of Doom!)

- Erim now casts Eerie light, Zap, and Thunder

Miscellaneous:

- PERCELYTE

- Grassei Kingdom

- ball of Chence

- Bunny girls restored

- One or two other minor bugs/errors

Disclaimer: In his own words, the creator of this hack never released it for the following reasons:

- "I never played through whole patched ROM to see if everything is alright. I verified that each of the changes I made works as intended, but I can't be 100% sure than I didn't screw some other things up while tinkering with the game."

- "The most important reason in my eyes: I never took the time to write the credits. Several people helped me during the creation of this patch, and I really wanted to mention all of them in the readme file."
