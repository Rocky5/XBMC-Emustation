Best of the Best: Championship Karate is a Kick Boxing game that features black belt kick Boxing masters. The object is to win the kick Boxing championship by defeating an array of Kick Boxing masters in a series of fighting matches.

Originally titled "Panza Kick Boxing" on home microcomputers in Europe, the game was retitled to "Best of the Best: Championship Karate" when it transitioned to home video game consoles. Note that the latter name makes little sense, given that the game is about Kick Boxing, not Karate.
