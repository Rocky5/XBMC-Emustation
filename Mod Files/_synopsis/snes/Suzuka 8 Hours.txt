_________________________
Suzuka 8 Hours allows the player to virtually participate in the grueling eight-hour long Suzuka race in Japan. While the game doesn't allow the player to play for 8 real hours (even in the Japanese Super Famicom version), he can play for 8 "virtual hours", which is translated to over 1? hours of "real time." The player controls a motorcycle on a closed race track intended for motorized two-wheel vehicles. The object is to complete as many laps as you can before time runs out. If time runs out, the clock starts going up again (as penalty time) and the next trip to the finish line ends the race.
