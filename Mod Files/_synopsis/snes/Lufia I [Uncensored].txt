_________________________
This patch changes all the following:

- Character Names: Dios, Erin and Arty are back to normal.

- Monster Names: Gardios and too many others to count.

- Censorship: Bars now sell booze instead of cider. Church is run by a priest instead of a grey-haired shemale. Bunny girls kiss the hero on the second floor of Forfeit Isle. The dress is once again a One-Piece swimsuit. All references to death restored in place of gloom. Shop sells Bunny Ears and Bunny Suits.

- Item Names: Brone to Bronze. Tan to Leather. Carbo to Holy. Might to Ancient. Stuffed Monkey. Rum, Vodka, Gin, Moonshine and Whiskey sold in stores. Lots more.

- Magic Names: All magic names restored to their original, unintelligible syllables. Have fun figuring out what does what. It's Phantasy Star IV again!

- Dialogue: Corrected the Gades in Sheran reference when Lufia first sees Gades so it is no longer Tarzan-speak.
