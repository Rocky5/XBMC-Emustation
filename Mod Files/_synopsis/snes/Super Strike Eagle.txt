_________________________
In Super Strike Eagle, the player controls a pilot for the United Nations. The player's objective is to bring various governments around the world back into cooperation with the UN. Each time a military campaign against a certain regime is completed, the flag of the nation in question is again raised at the United Nations Headquarters in New York City, New York, United States of America. The storyline begins with a practice round and then continues to progress. Targets become progressively difficult to destroy. Unlike most shooter games, the player only has one plane. If the player crashes, the game is over and a screen indicating the nations (if any) that were reclaimed by the player displays.

There are various types of targets in the game, including air, land and water targets. Land targets include nuclear power plants (but often include anti-air weapons and tanks); the player may suffer from radiation sickness after destroying nuclear plants when not at a safe distance to do so. The player will eventually need to use one of his/her limited sorties to have it healed; neglecting to do so will have fatal results. Weapons in the game include guns, missiles, electronic jammers, and bombs. Each mission on every war theatre consists of both mandatory and optional targets.[4]

Shooting the optional targets results in the accumulation of a higher score which can double as a respect meter for bragging rights. Furthermore, destroying airfields, although not necessarily required to complete a mission, would stop opposing fighters taking-off to take the player down. Although the game cannot be saved through a video game battery, there are a number of passwords the player can use to resume his/her mission at the appropriate place. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Japan approximately simultaneously. All three versions of this game use the English language for both text and speech and offer identical game play to each other.
