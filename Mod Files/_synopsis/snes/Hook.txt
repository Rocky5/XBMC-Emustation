Peter Pan has left Neverland and grown up. He is married to Wendy's granddaughter and now has two kids of his own.

Unfortunately, Peter has no memory of his life as the Pan in Neverland. In the meantime, Captain Hook misses his old adversary, and thinks of a way to get Peter Pan to return. Hook kidnaps Peter's children and takes them to Neverland.

Now Peter Pan must remember the lost joy of childhood in order to rescue his own children.
