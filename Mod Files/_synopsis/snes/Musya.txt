The story is about a pikeman named Imoto, who must descend to the abyss to save Shizuka, a maiden. After Imoto survives a battle in which all other combatants perish, he travels to Tengumura Village, where he collapses. The mayor, Akagi, greets Imoto and tells him that Shizuka needs to be rescued. Imoto heads into Tengumura Cavern.

Imoto, bearing 16 units of health (Qi, meaning "life energy"), dies when the health is depleted. He carries up to three lives. The game starts with three lives; once the life count is zero and Imoto dies, the game ends.

When Imoto defeats a boss, the words "monster defeated" appear and the player gains a scroll containing a new spell.

Musya uses Japanese kanji characters in various parts of the game to represent modes and levels. For instance, in the Japanese version of the game, the English-language word "Pause" is not used; instead the word Ippuku (meaning "break" or "to take a break") appears from both ends of the screen.
