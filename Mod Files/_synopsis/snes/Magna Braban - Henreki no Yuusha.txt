_________________________
Magna Braban is an RPG. You are in a castle, and you get some armor, and then you fight a guy and die. Then you come back and talk to the king and then you leave. Man, I hate reviewing Japanese RPGs.

So when you see the graphics, you will probably think "God damn, they ripped off Final Fantasy" because man, those sprites are totally FF, man. The combat's pretty weird, you just kinda watch as your party attacks this other party. Yup, see? Weird.
