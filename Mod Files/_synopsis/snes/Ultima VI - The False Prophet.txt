_________________________
Some years after Lord British has returned to power, the Avatar is captured and tied on a sacrificial altar, about to be sacrificed by red demon-like creatures, the gargoyles. The Warriors of Destiny suddenly appear, save the Avatar and collect the sacred text the gargoyle priest was holding. In Castle Britannia, the Avatar learns that the shrines of Virtue were captured by the gargoyles and he embarks on a quest to rescue Britannia from the invaders.

Tips:

Oil Glitch
This glitch can be done at any time, but it works best if you have a fair amount of gold (about 300). From the Castle you start in, head south until you see the sundial, and follow the road eastwards. There are two buildings next to each other, Iolo's Bows (Run by his apprentice) and a smith to the left of Iolo's Bows. Go to the smith, and buy as much Oil as you can carry. Head to Iolo's bows to the right of the Smith and ask the apprentice about SELL. This will allow you to sell items. The Oil was 4 gold, but you can sell an Oil for 10 gold here, a glitch that allows a profit of 6 gold coins per oil you bought and sold.  You end up with more gold then you had before you bought the Oil.
