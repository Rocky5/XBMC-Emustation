_________________________
Nightmare Busters is a platformer that fell to the wastelands of unreleased snes games. Gameplay wise, it is similar in style to Super Mario Bros. Unlike many games that were abandoned, this game was eventually released in 2004 for cell phones as Flynn's Adventure. A prototype was found by DuoFan. The game was being created by Nichibutsu, who is more famous for their board and racing games for SFC than plaformers. The developer was apparently a company called Arcade Zone, who developed the game Legend. The game was shown at Shinshokai 1994, and made it into Nintendo Power's 1995 preview issue.
