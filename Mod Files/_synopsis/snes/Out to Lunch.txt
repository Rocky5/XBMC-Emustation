Pierre le Chef is touring the world preparing his dishes, but his ingredients have escaped and he must capture them. Pierre must watch out for bacteria, insects, and his arch-rival, Le Chef Noir. Noir, an evil chef jealous of Pierre's success, wants to ruin his career by releasing all of his gathered ingredients.

Gameplay:

The objective is to capture a set number of ingredients before the time runs out. In later levels more ingredients need to be captured and more enemies appear. Ingredients must be caught in the net and emptied into the level's cage. Stunning the ingredients by jumping on them or hitting them with your weapon makes it easier to catch them because, when they are stunned, they stay still. Any number of ingredients can be captured before dropping them into the cage. Each captured ingredient drops into the cage individually over a short period of time while Pierre stands on it. After the required number of ingredients is in the cage a warp door will appear that will lead Pierre to the next level.

Between certain stages, if the right goals are met, there will be bonus a stage where Pierre tries to collect as many bonus items as he can before time runs out. There are also secret rooms in certain stages, which are revealed by completing the requirement to unlock the room. The secret rooms contain bonus items that increase your score and sometimes contain an extra life.

After Pierre runs out of lives or the game is beaten, the score is entered into the high score table and a title is awarded.
