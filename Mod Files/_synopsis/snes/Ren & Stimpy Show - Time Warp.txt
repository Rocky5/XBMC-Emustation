"To all Ren and Stimpy fans, do not play this game"

I wonder what was THQ on when they made this game. There was 4 Ren and Stimpy games for the Super Nintendo and I personally think that the games was pretty awful but this one takes the cake in my opinion. Poor graphics, poor gameplay and the horrible controls is what makes this game awful.

Story: Ren and Stimpy needed to find 47 million (that's way too much) proof of purchases to get a time machine so they can go back in time. Whatever, that's just a very bad story, but then again all Ren and Stimpy games have bad stories. Story gets a 1/10.

Sound/Music: The music is just one tune that plays over and over again. It is horrible. Get some CDs out if you manage to play through this "game". Be prepared to hear lots of screaming, burping and "Joy". Those are basically the only sound effects you will find in the game. Sound/Music gets a 1/10.

Controls: Horrible. Most of the time you can't get Ren and Stimpy to respond. It takes more than a few taps on the buttons just to get them to move. And they don't jump high enough either. They are slow, slow, slow. Control gets a 1/10.

Graphics: The only good thing about the game. Ren and Stimpy look exactly like their cartoon counterpart. The backgrounds weren't the best looking but then again, the show itself have horrible animation so I guess the backgrounds fit in to match the show. Graphics gets a 6/10.

Game Play: A mess. You play as both Ren and Stimpy. It's ridiculous. You have to find 47 million Gritty Kitty proof of purchases (which there are not 47 million proof of purchases in the game). You don't even finish the game because they don't find enough Gritty Kitty proof of purchases. Plus Ren and Stimpy keep dying a lot. The controls are so unresponsive it mostly interferes with the game play. Game Play gets a 1/10.

Comedy: This game's control, music and sound and game play is so horrible, it's funny. (Will not be counted in scoring)

Challenge: Way too challenging for such a short game.

Replay Value: I never would play this garbage again.

Buy/Rent/Avoid: Avoid at all times. Don't even bother buying it.

Pros
Great comedy
The graphics

Cons
everything else

The Total
Story:1/10
Sound/Music:1/10
Control: 1/10
Graphics: 6/10
Game Play: 1/10

The Final Total: A 2.

Conclusion: Ren and Stimpy was one of my favorite cartoons as a kid and the game doesn't really give it any justice. Even if you are a big fan for Ren and Stimpy, I wouldn't recommend this game to you unless you plan on playing a bad game.
