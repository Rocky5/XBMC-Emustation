_________________________
The plot of Veediots! is virtually nonexistent, due to the fact that all four levels are separate stories based on episodes of the TV series:

 - The Boy Who Cried Rat!: Ren evades Stimpy in the living room, then tries to survive in Stimpy's mouth and defeat the Tooth Beaver (referencing Ren's Toothache).
 - In The Army: Ren runs amuck at boot camp's training grounds, and finally faces the drill sergeant.
 - Stimpy's Invention: Stimpy must go through his lab collecting certain items within the time limit.
 - Marooned: Stimpy must survive inside the esophagus and belly of a space alien.

Tips:

Level Select
When the title screen appears, quickly press L, R, A, L, R, L, B, R, X BEFORE the word 'Veediots!' fully appears

Hear the Whole Theme Song
At the beginning of the game, the theme song plays for awhile and then fades away once the demos begin.
Press L and R to hear the whole song.
