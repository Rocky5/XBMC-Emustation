--from the SNES Street Fighter II instruction manual

Major Bison is holding a tournament for the greatest fighter in the world. With each character, they all have their own unique story! So whether you're Ryu, Blanka, Ken or whoever, you better be ready for some intense street fighting action!

Directions:

There are 8 fighters to choose from: Blanka, Chun Li, Dhalsim, E. Honda, Guile, Ken, Ryu, and Zangief. Each has their own special move, so use any type of button combo to find them out! And with three different types of punches and kicks, you can't go wrong!

There are two modes of play:
In "Game Start", you and you alone go around the world, fighting other fighters to win.
In "V.S. Battle", you and another player face off! 

Controls:

A Button - Mid Kick
B Button - Low Kick
X Button - Mid Punch
Y Button - Low Punch
L Button - High Punch
R Button - High Kick
Start Button - Make selections, pause/unpause
Select Button - Switch between options at title menu (control pad can also be used)

Tips:

Remove Energy Bars, Timers, and Sound
Go into the Options menu and press Start to return to the main menu. Repeat this process 27 times.

Same character in VS. Mode
Press Down, R, Up, L, Y, B at the Capcom logo.

Pass-by Opponents
In order to do this, you'll need to have a 'second player' and as 'Player 2' chooses his/her character (i. e. you choosing the character as 'Player 2's' character will be nothing more than a punching bag); you need to choose the character you're stuck on (which could be Chun Li, Honda E. or anybody else) and as you defeat that character that 'Player 2' is controlling; you'll realize that the computer will take you to the next character.  Note: You cannot do this when fighting M. Bison, Vega or any other character that is not available to be chosen when playing the game.

Configuration Screen
Hold the Select button while the world map is on the screen before a match begins. You will be able to change your controller configuration.

Extra endings
To get better endings, beat the game at the highest difficulty. Each character has a different ending, so you can have 8 different endings!

Extra Sounds
To listen to extra sounds on 1f to 23 on the Option Screen, go to sound 25, 26, or 27. Then rapidly press the R button. The new sounds should be there.

Get Full Character Profiles
Press and hold L and R on the second controller to see their profiles.
