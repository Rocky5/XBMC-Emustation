Super Conflict is a military simulation game played on a hex map in which players try to capture the opponent's "Flag Tank" or "Flag Ship". The map consists of various terrain tiles with movement and defense modifiers. For example, bridges and deserts lower the defense ratings of occupying troops; hills and mountains provide additional defenses but require more fuel to move through. There are over 55 different scenarios and 16 two-player scenarios.

Tips:

Change computer's weapon
Before the attack animation is played out, keep pressing the B button on controller 2.

Mission Select
At the scenario map hold L + B+X + Y, let go of X, hold it again, release them all and move the jeep up to the unit area. Press L + B.

Unlimited Ammo for Heavy Weapons
Switch your weapon after you've fired and you will hit with the weapon you switched to and not the one you fired.
When you are going to attack, fire your weaker weapon (which has unlimited ammo) and switch to your heavy weapon (which as limited ammo). NO ammo will be used by the heavy weapon: this glitch lets it have Unlimited ammo as long as you switch to it from the weaker weapon every time you attack.
