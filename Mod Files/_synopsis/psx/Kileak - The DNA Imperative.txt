_________________________
Scientist Dr. Kim has taken his experiments in genetic engineering one step too far. A strike team of the International Peace Keeping Forces is dispatched to his south pole base but is shot down before landing. As one of only two survivors it is your mission to enter the base, find Kim and stop his evil plans.

In first-person shooter manner you explore the levels of the base, destroy robotic enemies and search for the elevator to the next level. Your SJ107 assault suit features an automapping system and can be upgraded with better armor and weapons. It runs on battery energy which can be recharged at an energy station somewhere on each level. If doors are locked, they can be opened with a keycard or by solving a lever puzzle. The storyline is advanced through communications with your surviving comrade Carlos and through recordings found in the levels which can be watched at a computer station.
