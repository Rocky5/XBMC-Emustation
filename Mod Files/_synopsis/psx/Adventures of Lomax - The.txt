_________________________
Cute, green-haired yet halfwitted creatures Lemmings this time appear in a platform game. As the only survivor Lemming that managed to rescue himself from the evil spell of Evil Ed, you (Lomax) must stop Evil Ed's distracting effect over the LemmingLand.

In your quest most of your enemies will be Hench Lemmings which've been possessed by Evil Ed's evil spell. You will be mainly using your spin attack or -when grabbed- your magic helmet to free these imprisoned Lemmings from the spell.

You have also some special abilities like building a bridge, digging horizontally through certain obstacles (just like the other Lemmings games) or throwing a flaming helmet that will help you to accomplish your goal.
