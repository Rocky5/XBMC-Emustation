WWF King of the Ring Another wrestling clone released back in the days with a little differences such as skill ratings which gives it a little bit of a strategic feel. There are nine wrestlers total - Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Lex Luger, the late Yokozuna, Razor Ramon, Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, the late Mr. Perfect and in a twist a ninth wrestler the player can create with custom attributes. The game features one-on-one matches, championship matches, tag team matches and the King of the Ring tournament.
