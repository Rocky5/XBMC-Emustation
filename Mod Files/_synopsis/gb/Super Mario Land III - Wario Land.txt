_________________________
The third in Game Boy's Super Mario Land series of games provides more platform-jumping action. Only this time you don't control the world's most famous plumber; you control Wario, the bad guy introduced in Super Mario Land 2. Seeking a place to live after being kicked out of Mario Land, Wario sets off for Kitchen Island, where he has learned that the famous pirates of Kitchen Island have stolen the Princess gold statue, which is worth quite a lot and could be the answer to his problems.
