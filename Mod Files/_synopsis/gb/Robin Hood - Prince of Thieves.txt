England is in trouble.

Richard the Lion-Hearted, king of England, is off fighting in the Crusades, and while he's gone, the kingdom is ruled by the Sheriff and his evil black witch Mortianna.

Now its all up to you. Set yourself free, find friends in Sherwood forest, rescue the lovely Main Marian, and set England free!
