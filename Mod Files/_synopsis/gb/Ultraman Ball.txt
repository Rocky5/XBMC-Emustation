_________________________
You're Ultraman. Well not really, but bear with me for a sec. Now as Ultraman, you have the ability to turn into an indestructible ball, uh, thing, and bounce around and stuff. This is essentially what Ultraman Ball is all about. Sadly, this is not some crazy kind of mascot volleyball game, sorry kids. Go play Sanrio Cup instead.

Yep, being an indestructible bouncy ball is pretty damn nice. But being a regular Ultraman is pretty cool too. I mean, how else are you going to climb ladders? And you can use your hands to slowly slide down ledges, which you can use to your advantage to jump higher, Mega Man X-style. The key to Ultraman Ball, you see, is in your use of both forms. Why you're indestructible when you're all curled up in a ball and not when you're walking around like a normal human being, I don't know. You'd have to ask Ultraman.

Translation Description:

Everything's complete except for the SGB border and the ending credits. Both are entirely possible to translate, but InVerse just doesn't want to. Cool.

But yeah, other than that the whole game is completely translated, and very fun to play. So la!
