_________________________
Kid Dracula is a side-scroller and a parody of the Castlevania series. The difference is you play as a young vampire rather than a vampire killer.

Gameplay consists of very standard jump and shoot platform action. As you progress through the 8 levels, you gain the ability to perform spells, like turning into a bat. You will also receive guidance from your pal, the Grim Reaper.
