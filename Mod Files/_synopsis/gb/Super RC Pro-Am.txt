_________________________
Super R.C. Pro-Am is the Game Boy update to Rare's classic radio controlled car game. 4 computer or human racers attempt to get around the track as fast as possible while avoiding hazards like oil slicks and traffic cones. There are also weapons that you can use to disable the other cars temporarily.

The goal of the game is to collect the letter icons found on the tracks that spell "NINTENDO." Collecting the letters allows you to move up to faster cars and eventually win the championship.
