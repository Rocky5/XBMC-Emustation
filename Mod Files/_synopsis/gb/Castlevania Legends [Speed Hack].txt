One of the things that put me off about the Gameboy CV games was the slow walking speed of the protagonists. While I understand this was due to the old school Gameboys blurring very badly when ANYTHING moved, in the age of emulation it's just a pain in the ass.

Therefore, I hacked Castlevania Legends so Sonia moves faster than usual.

In v1.0, Sonia moved as quickly as when Burning Mode was activated. Due to complaints, I slowed her down a little (By using a different method to hack her speed), so Burning Mode still provides a speed bonus along with its other benefits.
