Mostly the game is generic with four different golfers to choose from, two amateur and two pros, each with their own degree of skill and difficulty and two 18-course holes to choose from.

Like many other golf games the player uses the d-pad to plot their trajectory and using the main buttons for the power meter. Players can also must adjust to the ever changing weather conditions and can choose from twelve different clubs depending upon the situation. A password feature is also present and two-player capabilities utilizing the Game Boy Link cable.
