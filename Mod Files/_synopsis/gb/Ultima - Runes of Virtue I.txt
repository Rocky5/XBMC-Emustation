_________________________
Runes Of Virtue is an action-RPG specifically made for the Game Boy. Taking place in the Ultima universe, your task is to gather the eight virtue rune stones from the eight dungeons which oppose the virtues. The Black Knight has stolen the virtues from the castle of Lord British, and it is your job to recover them.

Initially, you can choose between four characters. These characters are Shamino the ranger, Dupre the swordsman, Iolo the bard, and Mariah the mage. There are three modes of difficulty. Ultima vets will recognize many of the characters from the other Ultimas, including Sherry, Dr. Cat, and Chuckles.
