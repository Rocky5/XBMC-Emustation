This is a hack of Super Mario Land version 1.1 for gameboy. I started making this after playing Frank15's enemy rearrangement hack. I thought it was great but I thought it needed more. So I started touching up the graphics and stuff. Then I wound up getting the idea of colorizing it. I held that off till I finished making the graphics. I made sure to leave no graphic untouched. Anyhow I had downloaded a 2.4 colorizer long ago and used it to colorize this. There was some problems that all people who have colorized this expereinced. Luckily Parasyte offered to lend me a hand and fixed a problem I was having with the status bar. After the colorization I altered a few more sprites then released it. About a year later a friend (Ugetab) offered to help me further on my hack and fixed the remaining issues I have. And so now you have this version. I believe this will be the final version.

Features of this hack:

- Rearranged enemies.

- Improved graphics.

- Black and white and a special color version.
