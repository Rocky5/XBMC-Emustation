_________________________
Waterworld, based on the 1995 movie of the same name, has you assuming the role of Mariner; and tasked with the mission of protecting the Atollers from the vicious, pillaging Smokers.

The underlying concept of the game borrows heavily from Williams' coin-op classic, Defender. You must destroy all the enemies in the area, while preventing them from capturing the Atollers. If an Atoller is captured, you can still rescue it by destroying the Smoker before it leaves the playing area. Once all the enemies are gone, you'll be given a bonus based on how many Atollers you have remaining, and then move on to the next level. And, like old coin-ops, the game ends when you run out of lives.
