_________________________
Weird, weird game. I can only assume it's based on an anime of some sort, like most games like this. You're this robot, and you walk around and swing a sword at stuff. You can hold Up and push B to get a grappling hook thing that you can use to latch onto higher platforms. You can also hold Down and push A to jump really high, but seeing as how you can't move while you're doing that, the high jump's not very useful, other than being able to reach higher platforms in conjunction with your grappling hook. You can also use it to jump on to those kind of platforms that you can jump on to from underneath. You know? Yeah, those.

There's not much Japanese in the game to begin with, so even from playing it in its original pristine form, you're bound to enjoy it. The grappling control scheme starts out kind of weird, but after a while you kind of get "attached" to it. Hahaha. Haha. Ahem.

Translation Description:

Everything seems to be complete except the blinking message that appears whenever you start a level. (For the katakana-illiterate, it says "START".) This naturally is no hindrance to enjoying the game, and so I demand that you now download and enjoy this game.
