Bart &amp; the Beanstalk is a retelling of the classic Jack and the Beanstalk tale with Simpsons characters. Bart is sent to trade the Simpsons' last cow for some food and he ends up trading it to Monty Burns for some magic beans and a slingshot. Homer spits the beans out the window where they grow into a massive stalk reaching into the clouds. Using his slingshot and whatever he finds along the way, Bart must dodge obstacles and defeat enemies to get to the giant's castle in the clouds, then make it back down alive.

Bart &amp; the Beanstalk is a platformer with some shooter elements. You must jump your way between platforms and vines through all sorts of tricky hazards. Bart can also use his slingshot and various weapons he finds to defeat the enemies that block his path. There are seven levels in all.
