_________________________
This is my first released hack, a hack of Final Fantasy Legend.

I always hated that title, since it's a SaGa game and not a Final Fantasy game, so I changed the title screen to the Japanese name Makaitoushi SaGa.

I started this hack one day about a year ago but then stopped and didn't touch it until about a month ago. Then I finished it. So if you're like me and you love FFL but hate the title, give this hack a spin! :D
