Stop that Roach! is a turn-based strategy game where the player has to eliminate a number of cockroaches on each level.

The player has five turns in which he can move of a certain amount of tiles, place traps, stomp to frighten the cockroaches, step on them, hit them with a broom or spray them with an insecticide. Next come the cockroaches' turn, their actions being defined by precise rules.

If the insects can escape or reach the piece of food you're meant to protect, you lose the round. Victory is achieved if all cockroaches are either destroyed or captured.

The game includes a detailed tutorial with explanations of all the game mechanics.
