Darkwing Duck is a 2D 3rd person platform game featuring this Disney super-hero, friend of Lauchpad McQuack (the Duck Tales character who worked as a pilot for Scrooge McDuck).

As a decent super-hero, his role is to save the city from his enemies.

Graphics are cartoonish, like other Disney licenses developed by Capcom, but darker.

Gameplay is similar to Mega Man and Duck Tales, in the same jump and run style. Controls are easy to handle.
