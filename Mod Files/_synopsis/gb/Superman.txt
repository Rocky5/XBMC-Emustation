Superman is a sidescrolling action game starring DC Comics' titular Man of Steel. It features character designs based on Superman: The Animated Series. In each level, you must collect a certain number of keys, and possibly fight a boss, then step on a marked area to leave. Keys may be found around in the environment or collected from defeated enemies.

Superman attacks by punching his enemies, or by punching to deflect their bullets back at them. He can navigate environments through standard walking, or, he can hold down the jump button to fly. He must be careful of bombs which are floating throughout the levels as running into them causes loss of health. He also must face other environmental hazards, like electrical barriers.

Some levels put ground under your feet and play some like a normal platforming/fighting game, albeit with flight. Others are all flying and forced scrolling, making them something like a 2D shooter with no ranged attack where you must hold down a fly button to stay aloft.
