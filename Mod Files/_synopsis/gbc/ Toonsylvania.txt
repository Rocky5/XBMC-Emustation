Toonsylvania is a side-scrolling platform game based on the animated television series of the same name. In the game Dr. Vic Frankenstein's assistant Igor has invented some useful apparel. When he tries to test it on Phil however, things go wrong and Phil blows up. Now it's up to Igor to clean things up before Frankenstein comes back.

You play as Igor and work your way through 5 different worlds, to collect parts of Phil. Meanwhile you can collect inventions that improve your health and combative abilities. Igor can punch enemies and throw skulls at them from a distance. There are three secret levels in the game, which require an UBI key to be unlocked. One of the keys is hidden somewhere in the game, others can be obtained from other Ubi Soft titles for the Game Boy Color.
