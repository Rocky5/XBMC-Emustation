You've taken the first lift of the day, and now stand poised on the edge of an icy cliff. Choose your line, and prepare to carve into the fresh powder. Anyone who gets in your way is in for a face full of ice. Trick Boarder, only for the Game Boy? Color, brings the mountain to you! Fight it out with the big boys in the Grand Prix, race against the clock, or challenge a friend.
