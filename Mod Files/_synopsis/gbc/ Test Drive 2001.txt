This handheld Test Drive game lets you drive 13 licensed sports cars through 12 locations and 48 tracks. The action is viewed from an isometric perspective and some of the locations you'll drive through are Germany, Sydney and Washington. You start the game with a Lotus Elise, but as you gain more money you'll be able to buy other cars like Mustangs and Jaguars.

The game offers three modes. The first one, Single Race, involves beating the clock and other computer opponents on any of the tracks using any of the cars. In the tournament mode, you can earn extra money to buy new and better cars, or to upgrade your current car. You can also unlock additional tracks. In the Cop Chase mode, you take control of a police car and have to pursue the computer controlled racers. The game also have a two player mode allowing you to compete using the Link Cable.
