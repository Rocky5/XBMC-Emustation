What can really be said? It's Sylvanian Families. It's not everybody's cup of tea, but Ryusui has put a year's worth of tender love and care into the project, not to mention a lot of hard work!

Some nice hacking work was done on this game. If you have any love for cutesy type games or Silvanians, you really should give this one a try.
