_________________________
Taking place sometime after the events of the original Blaster Master, Blaster Master: Enemy Below puts you once again behind the wheels of Sophia 3 as a genetically engineered threat looms from the underground once again.

Gameplay-wise the game plays like a remake of the first game, with similar levels and challenges, and featuring the same on wheels/on foot dual gameplay modes while adding new weapons and upgrades.
