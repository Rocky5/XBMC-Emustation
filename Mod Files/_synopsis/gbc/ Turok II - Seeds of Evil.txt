The sequel to Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. Having defeated the Chronoceptor, Turok throws the leftovers into a waiting volcano, only to awaken an even deadlier force - The Primagen - who lays in wait for his freedom from a wrecked space craft, buried at the core of the Lost Land. Now it is up to Turok to once again restore peace to the land, and stop the Primagen from merging Earth with the nether world. New weapons, better graphics, more Turok!!
