Join the Tracy Family in old-school gaming in 7 mini games accross the whole wide world. Single player and story-driven, do YOU have what it takes to thwart the evil Hood? This game allows players to control Thunderbirds vehicles 1-4, The mole and FAB1 in a variety of mini games. TB1, a recon, and combat craft is a side scrolling mini-game involving bombing and shooting ground & air targets while looking for people to resuce and collecting intel on the area. TB2, the rescue craft is controlled from a top-down perspective and involves puzzle solving and exploration. TB3, the space shuttle, is a vertical-scrolling, top-down, old school shooter and TB4, the submarine, is a collection and combat game played from a side-on perspective. TB5, the Tracy Family Space Station is Brain often hangs out, updating the player with useful intel and story elements.

The Mole is a subterranean digging machine and gameplay in this mode involves exploration, combat and collection - though on the surface it's reminiscent of DigDug. FAB1, Lady Penelope's Rolls Royce is a time-based, top-down vertical scrolling driving game that captures the feeling of Chase HQ from the arcades of old. Each mission involves different combinations of these craft and they occur in places as diverse as Egypt, Bermuda, Nepal, the Rainforests of South America and London. The story reveals clues as to The Hood's intentions, but will you be able to piece them together before Brains? You have 28 levels before the Game is up...
