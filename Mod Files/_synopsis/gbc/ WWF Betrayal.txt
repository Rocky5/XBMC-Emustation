WWF Betrayal is not the typical WWF game, instead the gameplay is more reminiscent of Double Dragon. The player starts off as one of either four different superstars including The Rock, Triple H, The Undertaker or "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, after which the story kicks in. The story consists of the player's selected wrestler just moments away from winning the WWF Championship before getting hit from behind by an unknown assailant and defeated. They awake to discover that Stephanie McMahon has also kidnapped and her father Vince promises the player's character another shot at the title if they rescue Stephanie.

There are six levels to choose from as the player will transverse these stages and fight off referees, street punks security guards and even other WWF superstars with a punch, kick, a dropkick or through various weapons scattered throughout the stage such as steel pipes, nightsticks, 2x4's along with many more objects. Not only does the player have to defeat enemies they also have to avoid various traps and pitfalls such as patches of fire, floor traps and laser cannons to name a few.

There are also power-ups that are located in various places throughout the game which can replenish the player's health and power bar among many others. Additionally, when the player fills up their power bar they can unleash their character's unique finishing move such as the Stone Cold Stunner or the Pedigree on a selected enemy. There is also an option for a second player to join in using a link cable to team up and help out on their friend's journey.
