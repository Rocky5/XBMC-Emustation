Earthworm Jim is up against 12 levels of bad guys as he explores his bedroom. It's far from the adventures against Psy-Crow, but there are plenty of evil beings lying uner the bed that are just as dangerous.

It's an all new adventure, using similar elements to the previous 2 Earthworm Jim platform games on the SNES. Many of his zany attacks are here with a few added extras, plus the return of Professor Monkey-for-a-Head.
