_________________________
Based on the Tiny Toon Adventures Cartoon, the player plays Buster, who needs to survive 11 partially scrolling platform levels, in order to free his friends Babs, Pluck and Hampton from the clutches of Montana Max.

Each level is populated by several enemies out of a total of 23 different enemy types. They can be defeated with different types of balls that Buster has at his disposal (football, soccer and baseball), that vary in their behaviour. The Baseball travels at slow speeds horizontally and explodes if it hits walls. It stuns all enemies close to the explosion. The Soccer Balls bounces of the floor and is bound by gravity, meaning that it will drop of edges etc. The Football travels very quickly and diagonally bounces of everything for a set amount of time. Soccerball and Football 'kill' with direct hits.

Progress is tracked via a password feature and the story is told via cut scenes.
