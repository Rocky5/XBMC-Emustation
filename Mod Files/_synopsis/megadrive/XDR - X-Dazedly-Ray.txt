On the terrestrial planet Sephiroth, which is homez to a variety of peaceful and prosperous advanced societies, an ancient evil has returned. A long time ago, a warmonger known only as Guardia was banished from the planet, but has finally returned with an entire space military. The Guardia Military soon invades Sephiroth and crushes its defenses with its long hardened space technology. Within time, a space fighter was developed to match the power of the Guardia Military. Based on Guardia's unknown desire for destruction and it's own might, the ship was named the XDR: X-Dazedly Ray.

Gameplay:

XDR was incredibly straight-forward: players piloted the titular ship through six different levels blasting various ground and sky forces. Players could collect power ups such as different firing weapons, Options and items. Rather than having Bomb weapons, the ship was equipped to fire normal shots and missile pick-ups. Players could also change the ship's speed.
