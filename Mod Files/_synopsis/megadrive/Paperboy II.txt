Who ever said that being a paperboy was an easy job? In Paperboy 2, find out just how hard it can be! As either a paperboy or a papergirl, your objective is to avoid the obstacles that come with the job of delivering papers as you toss them to subscibers' houses. Failing to get the papers to these houses will result in their cancelling their subscriptions and you possibly losing your job. At the end of your route is a bonus round where you can rack up some extra points. Extra points can also be attained by accurate throws, breaking non-subscribers' windows, stopping burglars and runaway baby strollers, and watering sunbathers.
