Well, Rings of Power is insanely hard. You can wander forever without any luck. You can be killed instantly. Your money/food/water drains very quickly. The Naughty Dog staff made a great game, but the difficulty is very hard for any average player.

But now you can beat the game. You have lots of advantages in the hacked version "The Hand of Nexus":

- Your party is Invincible. You can't loose HP or MP on battle nor the Temple of Variation and Necropolis, except in some very rare cases where you can loose a bit of HP in battle.

- All your characters will gain the max level when you get them some experience.

- You will always have all the goods at max value.

- You will start with the So Sym, Map, Sextant and the Magic Leaf. No more need to go the annoying Magic Leaf maze.

- When you enter the map, you will teleport to any point where you left the pointer on it.

- You will start with max Food, Water and Gold.

- You have infinite Food, Water and Gold.

- You can access the Inventory in Battle! Just hold right and press start after you select the spells.

- You have all the spells of the whole party.

Thanks a lot to Pugsy and Ugetab, and all the cool people at GSHI. Without their support, I never could make this hack possible.
