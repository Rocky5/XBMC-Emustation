_________________________
Edson Arantes do Nascimento, commonly known to us as football legend Pel?, licensed a second football game, featuring the 24 qualifiers for the 1994 World Cup, each with summaries and tactical advice from Pel?. These can play in either friendly matches or the full tournament. A five-a-side mode is included, taking place on a full-sized field.

The view is isometric, although playing bottom-right to top-left, the opposite of FIFA International Soccer. Weather effects are optional, matches can be between 5 and 45 minutes (in 5-minute increments), and penalty shoot-outs are optional. A full range of formations are available, as well as squads of 22 fictitious players.
