NFL 98, Sega's final football game for the Genesis platform, uses the same engine as found in Prime Time Football starring Deion Sanders. Updates include player statistics and ratings based on the 1996 season, the ability to play a full 1997 schedule, Practice Mode, adjustable artificial intelligence settings, and the option to view both instructions and rules of play within the game.

The most notable new feature is customizing how either the computer or your team plays in the following areas (from zero to six, with six being the highest): player speed, speed burst effect, dive effect, defensive tackling, offensive fumbles, blocking, pass accuracy, aggressiveness, cause interceptions, pass deflections, pass interference, CPU kick accuracy, kick meter speed and injuries. Besides the different settings found within the Rookie, Veteran, All-Pro and Hall of Fame difficulty levels, you can save up to four custom settings per team. 

All other features are carried over from 1995's game, except for the option to play multiple season schedules. Players can still adjust game time (5,10 or 15 minute quarters), weather, field conditions, and even choose their own playbook from any team in the game. Speaking of which, 30 NFL teams are included from the 1996 season, as well as both AFC and NFC Stars, NFL All-Pros and six regional teams featuring stars organized by where they went to college. 

Complete roster management lets you organize your team as you see fit, including trades, substitutions, signing or releasing fee agents, and creating new players. Battery backup will store your season in progress, allow you to create and save up to 15 user records, track each team in 42 different categories and individual players in 32 areas. As in the previous two Sega football games, NFL 98 uses a vertical view of the field that will zoom in for a closeup once the ball crosses the line of scrimmage.
