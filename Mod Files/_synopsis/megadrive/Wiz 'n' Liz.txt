Wiz 'n' Liz are magicians. They live on the planet Pum and brew potions and cast spells. They also tend to wabbits. Lots of wabbits. One day, a concoction went awry and sent all the wabbits to distant parts of Pum. Wiz 'n' Liz set off to look for them.

Catch all the wabbits in tons of levels in several difficulty settings. Create magical words and mix ingredients for extra lives, bonus levels and other surprises. Features a password save system so you can take off where you left.

Gameplay:

The game takes place on a series of levels, each divided into eight worlds. Each world has a distinct graphical style and music, but the basic gameplay remains the same. Wiz and/or Liz must run through the landscape collecting the wabbits, against a strict time limit. To win, the player must collect floating letters which appear when a wabbit is collected, to spell out various words. Once collected, the player then must wescue all remaining wabbits on the level, collecting fruit, stars and clocks to increase the time limit. The limit starts at one minute and is only restarted when the player character dies. This time limit can however be extended by collecting a glowing orange orb which appears in the last ten seconds of a countdown and gives 30 seconds of bonus time.

Various kinds of fruit can be mixed in a cauldron, and depending on the fruit, the effect can be bonus points; a minigame; a weird graphical effect; a bit of silliness (such as declaring a "Game Over" and killing your character, only to put them back and sheepishly say "Only joking..."); turning the wabbits wed, bloo, or gween; or "Absolutely Nothing".

Like other Psygnosis games, Wiz'n'Liz features a number of cameo appearances from other Psygnosis characters, including Puggsy and Lemmings.

The Bonus game was featured in the original mid-90s run of competitive gaming television show Games World (broadcast on Sky One in the UK) as one of the challenges. Player took turns to play the Bonus game of collecting the bloo wabbits, and the highest scorer won that particular challenge. The game was not featured when the show was revived in 2000, largely because the Sega Mega Drive had become obsolete.

Hints:

- Bonus Round Cheat -
After completing the first round of any land with more than one round, wait for the words ''Push Start Button'' and ''Yeah!'' to appear. Hold A and C, and press Start. All the bonus letters will light up, letting you go to the bonus stage after you beat that land. Unfortuately, this trick doesn't work on every level.

- Cheat Passwords -
To fight against any of the screen-filling monster bosses in Wiz'n'Liz, enter the password TCDT GBBS. Other interesting passwords include BBBB BBBB, TTTT TTTT, CBSK LGQD and MQHS PKDN. The password MGTP GLLS will take you to the last round of the final level.

- Fight Any Monster Boss -
To fight any screen-filling monster boss, enter TCDT GBBS as a password.

- Half-Priced Items in Shops -
When the word ''Buy'' is highlighted hold Start and press C to cut all prices of items in half.

- New Difficulty Level -
When the Sega logo appears, hold A, B, C and press Start twice. You should hear a voice say ''Yeah!'' if you did it correctly.

- Open Shop and 100 Stars -
Simply press Start and hold C at the last letter of any valid password.

- Skip to Final Level - 
To skip to the last round of the final level, enter MGTP GLLS as a password.
