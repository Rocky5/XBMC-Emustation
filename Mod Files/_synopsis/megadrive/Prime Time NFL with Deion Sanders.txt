_________________________
In this sequel to Sega's NFL '95, Prime Time NFL Football starring Deion Sanders increases the difficulty, expands stat tracking to over forty categories, and adds a record book that saves top individual and team performances around the league. 

These complement established features such as the NFL and NFLPA licenses, all thirty teams including Jacksonville and Carolina, star players such as Troy Aikman and Steve Young, as well as player stats based on the 1994 season.

Prime Time also allows you to create, sign or release players, toggle injuries, customize playbooks, choose weather conditions, relocate any team to any city, play multiple schedules, and save up to fifteen user records.

View the action from 65 yards down the field so you won't miss that single coverage on third and long. Make the plays as the quarterback or elect to become the receiver at the line of scrimmage. You've played the other games, but are you ready for Prime Time?
