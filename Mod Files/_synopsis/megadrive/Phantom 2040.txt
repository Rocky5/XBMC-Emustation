Rebecca Madison is lurking somewhere in Metropia. This is a problem. She is bent on taking over the world, as so many evil characters are, but this time she has the resources to do it. Rebecca is head of Maximum Incorporated, a business specializing in biotechnology; a business specializing in death. As Kit Walker, aka the Phantom, you must traverse over 60 levels spanning the city of Metropia to stop her.

A map screen will let you choose a sector you want to explore, but don't expect a safe trip. Armies of biots are programmed to attack you! The Phantom can scale walls and swing from ceilings with his inductance rope, fire homing missiles from his smart gun, and even drop special pellets that explode on contact.

There are 14 weapons and five items in total, and you have the ability to control two weapons at a time. An inventory screen allows you to store all of the items and weapons collected for later use. Phantom 2040 also features 20 possible endings based on your performance during the game.

Trivia:

"Phantom 2040" is based on the cartoon series of the same name, which was an early Batman Beyond-like adaptation of the classic Phantom character set in the future.

Created by the legendary Lee Falk and first appearing in february 17th, 1936, The Phantom started his many adventures to rid the world from piracy and evildoers following the footsteps of his ancient lineage as the 21st "Walking Phantom" in the world. In practically no time Falk's newest creation rose to world fame under the King Features Syndicate banner, which placed it in tons of newspapers around the world (Falk was already a major-league player from his earlier success: Mandrake the Magician, and thus commanded true star treatment from his publishers) and remains to this day a well-known classic of comic book history. 

The character also made the leap out of the comic books many times, with a collection of 15 serials in 1943 from Columbia Pictures, an animated series in 1986 (along Flash Gordon and Mandrake) as well as a motion picture starring Billy Zane in 1996 by Paramount (besides the aforementioned Phantom 2040 animated series which had the particularity of being helmed by Peter Chung of Aeon Flux fame). So far this is the only videogame adaptation of the long-running franchise.
