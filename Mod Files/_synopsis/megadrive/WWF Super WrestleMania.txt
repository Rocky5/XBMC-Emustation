This was the first ever WWF licensed game for the SNES and Sega Genesis consoles. It featured one-on-one, tag team, and Survivor Series matches. The two versions were not identical because they featured some different characters for each console. The Genesis had: Hulk Hogan, Papa Shango, Ultimate Warrior, Macho Man, British Bulldog, IRS, Ted Dibiase, Shawn Michaels. Meanwhile the SNES had: Macho Man, Undertaker, Jake The Snake, Hulk Hogan, Earthquake, The Road Warriors, Typhoon, Ted Dibiase, and Sid Justice.

Directions:

Wear down your opponent in the ring blow by blow, suplex by suplex, kick by kick, until he is knocked out and ready to be pinned. If you're in need of help in the right match, tag your partner in for a double dose of beat down. Pin for the 1..2..3.. or get them out of the ring for the ten count and win the title!
