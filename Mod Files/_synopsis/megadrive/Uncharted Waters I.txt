Climb aboard your flagship and set sail! As a young Portuguese captain, you are in search of fortune and fame. With your first mate at the helm, navigate the way to distant lands and legendary riches. Port ho! Cast anchor in a new land and barter with stubborn merchants for exotic spices and gems. Use profits to improve your fleet or face the dangers of the sea-pirates, storms and the mysteries of the deep. Win allies for Portugal, and the King will reward you grandly!

Gameplay:

Uncharted Waters is a sailing and trading simulation. Your goal is initially to sail between ports and trade goods between them to make a profit. Along the way, you may be called upon by merchants and royalty to do specific tasks. Several different nations as well as pirates roam the sea and not all have good relations with one another. You can take as long as you want and explore as much of the world as possible to complete your ultimate task of marrying Christiana, which will require your fame rating to be quite high anyway. Available at most ports is a trader for cargo, a supply station for your crew's food and water as well as repairs, a shipbuilder, an item store and finally a pub for gaining information, crew and gambling.

All of the game progresses on an overhead-view, by sea you navigate your fleet by direction and can issue additional orders including landing on any piece of land to search for supplies. A variety of hazards live at sea including storms, other ships, seaweed and simply bad winds and currents.
