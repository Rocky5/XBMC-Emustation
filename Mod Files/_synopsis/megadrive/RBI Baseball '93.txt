R.B.I. '93 puts you into the big leagues with nearly 700 REAL Major League Baseball Players from all 28 professional rosters, including Colorado and Florida. Plus you'll face them on their own turf - from Chicago's friendly confines to the big Green Monster of Boston.

Hints:

- See the Credits -
At the Options screen, press A, B, and C simultaneously 256 times. That's 256 times. No, it's not worth it unless you have a rapid fire controller.
