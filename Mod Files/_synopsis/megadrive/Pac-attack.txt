_________________________
A combination of Pac-Man and Tetris, Pac-Attack mixes the ghost-gobbling action of the former with the falling block puzzle aspects of the latter. Your job is to maneuver the blocks into lines so they will vanish from the screen. Ghosts also fall from the top of the playfield, getting in the way of the solid lines you are trying to form. Luckily, Pac-Man accompanies the falling blocks from time to time, allowing you to maneuver him into a position to munch the ghosts. 

Similar to Tetris, the Normal mode of play in Pac-Attack continues until the blocks and/or ghosts have stacked up to the top of the playfield. Each ghost Pac-Man eats adds a little gold to the Fairy Meter. When the meter is full, a fairy jumps onto the screen and throws a gold dust spell, effectively removing all the ghosts below it. The 2 Player VS Game features head-to-head, split screen action. Here the winner is the player who lasts the longest in two out of three rounds.

Gameplay:

In the Puzzle game you complete a level when you have gotten Pac-Man to eat all of the ghosts. If all of the ghosts have not been eaten after a certain number of blocks and ghosts have fallen from the top of the screen, you lose. You can retry each of the 100 levels again and again, and a password feature lets you save your progress.

Hints:

Enter password JFK, and you get the game ending as well as the credits.
