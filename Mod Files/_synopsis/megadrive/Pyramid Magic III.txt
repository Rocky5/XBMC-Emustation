_________________________
The archaeologist from the first two Pyramid Magic games is back on the job...but this time, he's brought along a jug of water to quench his thirst as he explores each room in the Pharaoh's long-abandoned tomb. Can he escape the pyramid with both its glittering treasures and the water that keeps him clinging to life?

Like the previous games in the series, the object of Pyramid Magic III is to collect a series of keys that force open the barrier blocking the exit. These keys can be found by kicking open wooden boxes and treasure chests. However, the archaeologist won't be allowed to walk through the exit empty-handed! The large stone pillar will continue to block his path to the next stage until he carries the water jug through it.
