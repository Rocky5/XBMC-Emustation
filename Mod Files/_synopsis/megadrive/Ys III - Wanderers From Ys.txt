Years have passed since the swordsman Adol saved the kingdom of Ys from certain destruction. Joined by his companion, the ex-thief, Dogi, they set out for new adventures. And just in time...Bizarre tales of monsters and demons wreaking havoc throughout the Kenai Region reach our heroes. Dogi's hometown of Sarina is in the middle of the afflicted kingdom. He inspires Adol to help him rid the world of this new evil. Join them as they battle the forces of darkness - Deep in a haunted coal mine in the heart of an active volcano and on top of a blizzard swept peak. All the while uncovering clues to the identity of the malevolent force that is guiding the evil warriors of the Dark World.

Gameplay:

The gameplay of Ys III is a sharp departure from the previous two games. Instead of the previously used top-down camera view, Ys III has become a side-scrolling platform-action styled game. The combat has also changed: the player must push a button to make Adol swing his sword and attack enemies.

The RPG-style statistics and experience system still exists in Ys III, however. A new addition to this area is the "ring" system: Adol can acquire and equip rings that provide special effects while equipped. A new attribute, "Ring Power", is consumed while rings are active.

Hints:

- Restore Health -
Hold Up on controller two when the Sega logo is displayed. During game play, enter the status screen and hold C. Press Up, then Down.

- Level Up -
Reset the game while holding Up, A, B and C on controller 2.

Start the game with the buttons held down, wait until you can open your status screen. On the status screen, enter the code below

CodeEffect

On controller 2 holding C, press uppressing up raises your level

- Use the Amulet to max out your Levels, HP, and Gold -
When you are on the verge of raising a level, use the third and final charge of the Amulet on the monster that would've raised your level. The game will freeze for a second, the screen will flash, and your levels, HP, and gold should max out, along with the message that your Amulet is exhausted of it's powers. YOU MUST USE THE THIRD AND FINAL CHARGE of the Amulet for this trick to work!

This trick will not work in boss fights.

NOTE: This trick does not work on the SNES version of Y's III.
