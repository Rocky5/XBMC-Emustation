European Club Soccer brings the Big Match excitement of Europe's favorite sport to the Sega Genesis. Play over 170 teams from around the world and compete for the Super Cup, soccer's highest accolade and exclusive to European Club Soccer!

Directions:

As in any soccer match in real life you simply, while having the ball in possession, try to score a goal by getting the ball into your opponents net. While on defense try to steal the ball. The matches are long and of course best score wins!

Gameplay:

Gameplay is simple, and works only with two of the buttons of the gamepad - "B" is used to pass the ball low, and "C" to lob the ball. While a button to shoot is absent, if a button is held pressed, when released the ball goes at a much higher speed. The directional button can also be used to give after touch in lobbed balls and change direction or touching the ball backwards with the heel in low passes. Optionally, the "A" button can be used to swap to the nearest player, if the automatic option is disabled.

The game puts several tactics at the disposal of the player, while the computer has a predefined tactic for each team. Each tactic has its own advantage: the 4-3-3 tactic using a sweeper is the only one that allows a player to recover if the goalkeeper is beaten and 4-4-2 allows midfield control from the wings, for instance.
