Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter, released in 1992 by SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade platform. By default, 1P and 2P can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled.

Directions:

Move your space craft around, trying to dodge enemy attacks and not to clash with other moving objects. Shoot your lasers in defense and try destroying anything you see. Grab power-ups for a boost and use special weapons on enemies that are a bit tougher!

Gameplay:

Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.

One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.

Controls:  

A Button: Special Gun
B Button: Shoot
C Button: Special Gun
Start Button: Pause
