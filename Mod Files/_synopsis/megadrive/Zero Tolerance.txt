_________________________
The space station Europe-1 has been overrun by aliens. During one of the fights the nuclear cooling system has been damaged, resulting in a meltdown within hours. Your mission, as a team of five of the toughest persons in the Corps, is to infiltrate and gain control of Europe-1. You must sweep the entire station clean of aliens.

Directions:

One of a few first-person-shooters on this console. It is required that you kill every single alien on each of the levels (hence the name). The five members of your team, who have different skills, start out with different weapons, are your five chances of seeing this through. This adds a level of strategy to the game.

Gameplay:

Zero Tolerance is made up of 40 levels spanning three separate areas: the space station Europe-1, the central command building for the Planet Defense Corps, and the sub-basement areas of that building. The object of the game is to kill all of the enemies on a level and then proceed to the exit, which is either a staircase or elevator leading down to the next level. However, nothing prevents the player from heading straight towards the exit without killing all of the enemies. If this is done, the player is simply not given any passwords until the entire area is finished.

- Weapons and Items -
Zero Tolerance contains a healthy selection of weapons. Each one is different and offers its own set of pros and cons. During gameplay, additional weapons can be picked up simply by walking over them as in other first-person shooters. To equip a weapon, the C button is pressed until the desired weapon is selected from the list of inventory items at the top of the HUD.

    - Hand to Hand Combat
    The most basic weapon of the game is your character's own punches and kicks. Selecting an empty item slot on the HUD and hitting the attack button causes the character to throw a punch. This can be modified by holding Up or Down on the D-pad, which will produce either an upper cut or a kick, respectively. Hand to hand combat is really meant to be a last alternative in the game.

    - Pistol
    The pistol offers you a basic projectile weapon. Ammo for it is plentiful, although it is weaker than other weapons.

    - Shotgun
    This weapon offers the advantage of increased power and easier aiming on the player's part. Like the pistol, ammo for the shotgun is easily found throughout the game.

    - Flame thrower
    Useful in creating a wall of fire that can stop a wave of enemies. There are a few drawbacks with the flame thrower, however. First, the ammo supply tends to be drained quickly, and flame throwers aren't as common in the game as other weaponry. On top of this, it is difficult to aim with this weapon.

    - Pulse Laser
    The pulse laser is a cross between a rifle and a laser gun. It fires invisible laser bolts in short bursts. The advantage of this weapon is that it is extremely effective against boss enemies. Unfortunately, it is not a common item in the game.

    - Grenades
    Much like their real-life counterparts, grenades are explosive devices which are thrown at enemies. They have a splash damage effect and are useful for clearing out smaller rooms.

    - Rocket launcher
    Fires an explosive missile. Like the grenades, these missiles also have a splash damage effect.

    - Laser Aimed Gun
    This is essentially an automatic pistol with a laser sight attached to it. It fires in short bursts rather than a single shot. Although it does not appear in the first area of the game, it is quite common in the second and third areas.

    - Mine
    This explosive weapon is difficult to find on the game but can prove very useful if being chased by multiple enemies. A mine can be left anywhere on the floor and will be detonated whenever an enemy walks over it. Like the granades and rocket launcher each mine has a certain amount of splash damage which is useful for clearing groups.

    - Medi-Pack
    This item restores the health of the player when damage is taken from enemies. It's effectiveness can be based on the particular skills of the character chosen by the player.

    - Bullet-Proof Vest
    Every so often a player may come across a bullet-proof vest. This item will shield the player from damage from enemies but only for 10 hits. It cannot be replenished by a medi-pack.

    - Bio-Scanner
    This item will allow players to see all the enemies on the radar without having to actually trigger their attack. This can be very useful for tight corridors where the player will be able to tell how many enemies are waiting ahead and where. However, this item does have a limited battery-life.

    - Night Vision Goggles
    On some levels of Zero Tolerance the distance of the map can appear misty and gray reducing vision into the distance. When a player picks up night vision goggles, this effect will be reduced. The view goes from full colour to green and black, and enemies can be seen more clearly at greater distances. However, this item has a limited battery life.

    - Torch
    Again, on some levels the distance of the map may appear dark and black. However, with the torch equipped the distance seen is increased, making it easier to spot enemies further away. However, this item does have a limited battery life.

    - Fire Extinguisher
    Areas on Zero Tolerance are sometimes blocked off by fire, when equipped the fire extinguisher can clear a path through the fire. Also note that when a player comes into contract with fire it will drain health regardless of whether or not the player has the Bullet-Proof Vest equipped.
