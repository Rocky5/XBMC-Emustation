_________________________
Streets of Rage 3 was the third SOR title, a 24-meg cart released by SEGA in 1994 exclusively on its most popular console, the Mega Drive. It featured a whole host of gameplay upgrades and innovative ideas that arguably made it the best title in the series (technically speaking, at least): the ability to run and dodge made for much faster gameplay, and a whole new set of moves with support for the 6-button SEGA controller. There was now a more complex plot and multiple ending scenarios.  

The game featured a new playable character who was central to the storyline: Dr. Zan, and also unlockable characters Shiva (Mr. X's right hand man) and Roo (a boxing kangaroo), alongside Skate and series regulars Axel and Blaze. Adam and Max are only seen in the game's cutscenes/endings.

In Bare Knuckle III, the Asian-region version of the game, Mr. X's Syndicate detonates a nuclear bomb in Wood Oak City, killing thousands of people. They then kidnap General Petrov, the highest ranking member of the US Military so that they can send an imposter to take his place and stir up a nuclear war between the United States and the country of Lima. Mr. X is now a brain in a jar, having lost his body in the events of Streets of Rage 2. 

This storyline (and intro cutscene) was censored in Streets of Rage 3 (A more detailed look at these differences can be found in our dedicated Bare Knuckle III section) - General Petrov was replaced by the Chief of Police, and the Syndicate was instead trying to replace key city officials with robot doubles, so that X could rule the city by remote control. 

As one of the four playable characters, you must battle your way through 6 levels of hot SOR action to rescue General Petrov/Police Chief O'Hara. If you don't reach him in time, you have to go to the White House/City Hall and stop Shiva from stirring up trouble. If you do manage to rescue him, however, you go to the Syndicate Stronghold where the X Robots are being produced, and after a confrontation with Dr. Dahm, you must face Mr. X himself, who battles with a robot body called 'Robot Y'. 

Streets of Rage 3's soundtrack is more abrasive and experimental than the classic club tunes of the previous titles, and as a result it was less popular with most players, though it does have its fans.

Introduces: ZAN, SHIVA, ROO (playable), ASH (Bare Knuckle III Only)
