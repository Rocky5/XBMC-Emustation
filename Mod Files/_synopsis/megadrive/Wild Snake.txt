"Snakes! Why Did It Have to Be Snakes?"

The nest of deadly snakes has been disturbed by seismic experiments in a remote location. Now the snakes are slithering to the surface, causing confused terror in attacks on everything that crosses their path.

There is a way to control this madness, but it's not going to be easy. The snakes from this nest tend to eat snakes of the same color and design. If you can guide the slithering masses so that snakes of the same type meet and eliminate each other, then the world could be saved from this snake infestation.

It's all up to you! Guide the snakes, find matching pairs and keep the population under control!
