The 8-Meg PGA European Tour updates 1992's PGA Tour Golf II with five new courses, ten new professionals to play against, and an eight-player elimination tournament. These features go along with everything found in the previous Genesis PGA Tour game, including the horizontal swing gauge and draw and fade meter. The featured European Tour players are as follows: Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, J.M. Olazabal, Tony Johnstone, Ian Woosnam, Sandy Lyle, Rodger Davis, Ronan Rafferty, Colin Montgomerie and Constantino Rocca.

Players can participate in a Practice Round, 72-hole Tournament (against an additional fifty European roster players), Skins Challenge, Match Play, Shoot-Out, or work on their long or short game on either the Driving Range or Putting Green. As in PGA Tour Golf II, you can save your golfer to battery along with statistics such as earnings (in pounds), average, Best 18, Best 72 and number of wins. Curious about the European courses? Players can compete at the Wentworth Club, Forest of Arden, Crans-sur-Sierre, Le Golf National and Valderrama.
