Sonic 1 Pixel Perfect is a hack of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis by JcFerggy and NovaWizard. The hack features new extended layouts and art, custom loops and tubes, dynamic palettes for the acts, and a complete GHZ layout (with edited boss) as of the first beta release. 

General:

Sonic 1 Pixel Perfect started as an art-based hack by JcFerggy. The idea was to give the player an experience that kept close to the original formula, without adding any major ASM changes.

History:

Around October of 2007, the team at the time was trying to go in different directions. Thorn and DNXDelta were planning a whole dynamic music system, with a strategy oriented layout, while JcFerggy and NovaWizard had more of a passive idea in mind. Either way the group split. JcFerggy and NovaWizard continued to work on Pixel Perfect while Thorn and DNXDelta started work on a Sonic 2 hack, Sonic 2 Retro Remix.

Currently:

As of now, Pixel Perfect is still a work in progress, but progress is slow since JcFerggy has other things to do. The main priority is art, but sometimes JcFerggy likes to mess around with the loops and tubes. Several people have offered to help out, but things like that will revealed at the next release/big update.
