Street Racer is a racing game, similar to Super Mario Kart, released for the Super Nintendo and Sega Mega Drive in 1994, the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Game Boy in 1996, and also the Amiga, Amiga CD32, and PC. It was made by UbiSoft and Vivid Image, and features nine cartoon characters which you could race with, one of which being a secret character unlockable by completing the game. It was one of the first games to feature multi-tap compatibility, and was the first racing game to allow 8 players to race simultaneously.

Despite the similar logo style Street Racer has no connection to the Street Fighter series by Capcom, nor to the game Street Racing Syndicate by Namco.

Gameplay:

The game features the ability to race the Street Racer Championship, beginning with the Bronze Championship and moving on to the Silver Championship, Gold Championship and Platinum Championship. Each championship gave you, after winning, a new password which could be entered on the Options Screen in order to unlock new tracks. The winner of the championship would be the driver with the most points after every race has been completed. Points are awarded according to the final positioning of each race, with bonus points awarded to the driver with the most punches, the most stars collected, the fastest lap, a record lap and drivers who lapped other drivers. The Championship could be raced in Championship, Head-to-head or Practice mode.

The game also featured the ability to choose the tracks for a Custom Championship, to drive a head-to-head series with a CPU driver, and to drive individual practice races. There was also a racing game called "Rumble", the objective being to knock the drivers out of a ring. It could be played in 3 levels of difficulty. Also, a "Soccer" mode (not in the Playstation version) featured a field to play against all other characters, with a giant soccer ball and a single goal for all. The score wasn't of team play though.

For all modes of play, whether Championship, Custom Championship, Rumble, or Soccer, Street Racer allowed the setting of many of the game parameters.

- Characters -

There were 8 characters who could be raced with in Street Racer. These were:

    - Hodja Nasreddin - A 400 plus year old Turkish magician, described as 'friendly' and 'wise'

    - Frank Instein - A 100 year old, big, green, Frankenstein lookalike

    - Suzulu - A middle-aged African Voodoo specialist

    - Biff - A 19 year old typical 'school bully' figure from America

    - Raphael - A young, 'cool' pimp figure from Italy who 'secretly admired' Surf

    - Surf Sister - A young Australian girl with a 'degree in mechanics'

    - Helmut von Pointenegger - A retired German pilot and veteran of the First World War

    - Sumo-San - A Japanese sumo wrestler from the future

    - Comeeo- A fat pimp from Austin who wants to pimp out the other racers.

Each character has four special moves. They have a defensive move, an attacking move and left and right punches, which vary for each character. These moves are unlimited and do not require pick ups making it unique from most racing games.

After winning the Platinum Championship a ninth character, Rabbit, also becomes available. Rabbit's abilities are similar to Raphael's, but slightly better all around. After Rabbit is unlocked one driver is randomly left out of each championship or race so that there are only eight drivers racing on the track.

- Tracks -

At first there are only eight tracks available on Street Racer. There is one track for each driver, named after the driver with the number one after (for example, Frank 1). After winning the Silver Championship a second track for each driver becomes available, and after winning the Gold Championship a third becomes available. When Rabbit is unlocked after winning the Platinum Championship three more tracks themed around Wonderland also become available.

Each set of tracks is themed around the track they are named after, with in-race music to suit. For example, Hodja's tracks have a magical theme and music, whilst Sumo-San has upbeat, futuristic, oriental music with a very Middle Eastern style of race track.
