_________________________
Take control of the title character or her little raccoon friend, Meeko, in this adventure based on Pocahontas, the Disney animated film from 1995. Pocahontas must learn the nine special animal spirits as she ventures out into the wilderness to prevent a war between her Powhatan tribe and the English settlers. The game is separated into three acts and takes place in the forest, at the long house of Chief Powhatan, at an English settlement, inside a ship, and in various natural Virginian surroundings. 

When the game begins, Pocahontas can walk, climb, short jump and push objects, while Meeko can run, climb trees, jump, jump into Pocahontas' arms, push small objects and tread water. In order to gain special powers (such as night vision, swimming and sprinting), Pocahontas, with the help of Meeko, must free nine animal friends from various predicaments. Switch between the pair at any time and use each character's strengths to figure out how to reach the end of the level.

Various puzzles appear throughout each level as you explore your surroundings. For example, you cannot simply enter the front door of the long house, so you must find another way in. Ledges sometimes appear to be out of reach and some objects seem impossible to move. These and other puzzles await your gaming expertise. Players can resume progress by entering passwords awarded at the end of each level, and cinematic cut-scenes help further the story as the characters advance through the game.

Trivia:

Released to theaters in 1995, Pocahontas tells the story of a brave and free spirited woman who defied her tribe and her father (Chief Powhatan) by falling in love with an Englishman named John Smith. Voice actors for the film include Irene Bedard, Judy Kuhn and Mel Gibson.
