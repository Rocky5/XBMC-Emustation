Not for the feint of heart! But those ready for challenge, get ready for the Evil Overload!. Features:

- Every piece of equipment has had some alteration done to it, from a different strength or opened to use by new characters. There are even many new ones!

- All the characters learn more Techniques.

- The guns have been given major improvements to be better than many bladed weapons and some award defensive bonuses.

- An all-new storyline!

- Every shop inventory has been changed.

- All the enemies give double Experience and double Meseta in comparison to the originals to speed the pace of the game.

- Each character levels up at a different rate, and the weaker ones get massive boosts from level 35 and up.
