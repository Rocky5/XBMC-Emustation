_________________________
Powermonger takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

Gameplay:

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game. Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.

Hints:

- Conquest Password -
Select the ''Restore Conquest'' option and enter the password 2MNOA2WSD. Now you should be able to select any of the 195 territories on the map.

- Last Level Password -
Use this code to warp to the last level: TJ3DP2TJW7TI5PJ3DJ4PJLIKPHAKJEKOGO
