_________________________
An overhead scrolling fantasy shoot 'em up, Twinkle Tale casts the player in the role of the young witch Saria, in a quest to rid her magical floating island of the evil creatures that have invaded it.

Gameplay:

The game is played from an overhead perspective, with Saria having complete freedom of movement in all directions and with the objective being to clear out all enemies in all 9 stages, looting whatever treasure you can find and defeating each stage's boss.

Saria's offensive weapons come pre-defined as three different spells, which you can freely switch to at any time and level-up by collecting power stars, as well as screen-clearing bombs.

Hints:

- Level Select - 
At the story book screen when you just start a game, hold up-left, A, and C simultaneously and press start.

Translation Description:

As usual, this MIJET patch is dual language. Which region has auto-detect priority determines whether it's in English or Japanese. The script is polished appropriately and well presented.

As MIJET indicated in the readme, S. Hard appears identical in challenge to Hard. This is almost true. As you go up the difficulty settings, the general trend is an increase in enemy HP, especially boss HP. No such increase is made between Hard and S. Hard. However, the bullets and attacks are somewhat faster in S. Hard. MIJET unlocked this mode for you so you don't have to beat the game once just to do so.
