Television is no longer enough for Pink Panther; he wants to be a Hollywood movie star. During his first audition, the Pinkster manages to spoil a scene starring the famous Inspector Clouseau. Feeling like his chances at stardom are ruined, the inspector seeks revenge. He chases Pink Panther through the various back lots of Hollywood studios, wrecking the sites of such movies as Pinkenstein, Pink Beard and Cat on a Hot Pink Roof. While running scared through the movie sets, Pink Panther must dodge or kill everything from rats to dinosaurs to animated cowboy boots. Luckily, he's armed to the teeth. His arsenal includes a detonator, a fly swatter, a sledgehammer, a can of bug spray and other useful weapons. Also, he can jump on the various critters to get rid of them. To assist Pink Panther in his getaway, toll gates are available. When Pink Panther drops a coin in the toll gate, he gains access to another level or platform.
