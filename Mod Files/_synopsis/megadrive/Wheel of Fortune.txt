_________________________
A very basic translation of the popular game show Wheel Of Fortune, where you guess letters until you can guess the phrase. This CGA version has three old-school rounds of Wheel of Fortune (where the puzzles are simply "Phrase", "Title", "Person", etc.) and then a bonus round. You can compete against 2 computer players or up to three people can play against each other.

Directions:

Just like in the very popular game show, you spin the wheel with a certain amount of power and land on the money amount. Then guess a consonant and you get that money amount times the number of letters you guess in the word(s). Buy vowels to help you out and solve! Person with most money is victorious!
