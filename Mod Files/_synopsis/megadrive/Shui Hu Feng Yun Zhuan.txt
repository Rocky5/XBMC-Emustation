This is a strategy RPG based on the events of the famous classic Chinese novel "Shuihuzhuan" (Water Margins, also known as Outlaws of the Marsh), which tells the story of 108 heroes who fought against the corrupt regime of the Song dynasty (12th century). You take control of a group led by Song Jiang, a famous robber and the leader of the heroes, starting as the young Zhao He. Their town is under attack by imperial soldiers, and their long quest for freedom begins with this battle...

The game is a console-style turn-based strategy RPG. The game mainly consists of large battles, but you can also move your characters from top-down perspective, enter buildings, buy things, and travel from town to town on the world map. During the battles, you move your characters freely around the location and attack or cast magic when there are enemies in range.
