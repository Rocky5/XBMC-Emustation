This is a thorough alteration of Phantasy Star II for the Sega Genesis that changes nearly every facet of the game. It slightly lowers the difficulty from the notoriously difficult original, it now ties-in better with the rest of the classic Phantasy Star series, with a completely rewritten story, and the great surprise veterans have wanted for over a decade! So newcomers and veterans alike, come enjoy the Numan Revolution! Features:

- Every piece of equipment has had some alteration done to it, from a different strength or opened to use by new characters. There are even many new ones!

- All the characters learn more Techniques.

- The guns have been given major improvements to be better than many bladed weapons and some award defensive bonuses.

- An all-new storyline!

- Every shop inventory has been changed.

- All the enemies give double Experience and double Meseta in comparison to the originals to speed the pace of the game.

- Each character levels up at a different rate, and the weaker ones get massive boosts from level 35 and up.

- Brand new monster sprites and a new enemy!
