They're back! The world's wildest cat and mouse team returns in an all-new animated adventure filled with non-stop action, frantic antics and an outrageous bunch of baddies. This time out, it's up to you to help both Tom and Jerry save their new friend, Robyn, from some fiendish foes - including cruel Captain Kiddie and the evil Aunty Figg. Together you'll have to conquer 8 completely chaotic levels filled with awesome obstacles and incredible enemies - all while trying to grab as much cheese and fish as you can get your paws on! And remember, you're here to beat the bad guys - not each other! So get it together, guys. Robyn's counting on you!

Directions:

Run through town, houses, or whatever else you need to get through without losing all your health (or nine lives), or falling into holes! Jump over enemies or throw items you have picked up throughout the level, and just make it to the end intact!

C Button: Throw Item
