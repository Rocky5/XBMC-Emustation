_________________________
Caught in a violent storm, Richard Tyler crashes his bicycle into a tree, leaving him dazed and confused. He shrugs off the wreck and goes to the nearest building which happens to be the library. But this is no ordinary library. This library is a world of horror, fantasy, and adventure, crawling with animated characters derived from the many stories contained in the books lying and flying about. The librarian, a mysterious man called The Pagemaster, informs Richard that in order to return to the outside world of reality, he must find the library exit.

As Richard Tyler you must run and jump your way through 68 levels of bats, ghosts, pirates, skeletons, fire creatures, and other nasties from the world of literature. In addition to jumping on top of and over your enemies, you'll find weapons such as gooey eyeballs, a pirate's sword, and magic dust. To help you in your quest through the magic library, you'll find magic shoes for jumping power, sticky hands for enhanced climbing ability, helmets for temporary invincibility, skulls for extra height, and of course books, which can you can arrange as you like. At the end of each level, a 3D bonus flying game puts you in the air collecting gold tokens (100 gives you an extra life) and magic dust. If you survive until the end of the bonus world you'll receive a special reward, usually an extra life.
