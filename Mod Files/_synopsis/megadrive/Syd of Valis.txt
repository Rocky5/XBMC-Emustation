Yuko Ahso is an ordinary grammar school student, but she is also the Valis.

"I defeated King Rogles of the Dark World with the Sword which was given to me by Queen Valia, but my friend Reiko died in the process..."

Yuko hasn't the slightest idea if she will be summoned to fight again.

"YUKO..."

"That voice is... uh...!? Reiko?
Why?! Reiko is Dead, isn't she..?!"

"Go and see Queen Valia, Yuko..."

Who is Megas, Yuko's new enemy? Now, the new adventure for Yuko has begun!

--from the Sega Genesis Syd of Valis instruction manual

Gameplay:

SYD of Valis is a reworked version of the action-platformer Valis II with simplified gameplay and a "Super Deformed" and kid-friendlier graphic design.

In the game you play as Yuko (Syd in the localized version), a teenage schoolgirl that can wield the magical sword of Valis and must travel to the dreamworld of Vekanti to defeat the evil lurking within it.

The game plays as a side-scrolling action platformer, in which you avoid obstacles by running and jumping around, and must defeat enemies by striking them with your blade. You can collect power-ups that include different weapons and armor types, all of which you can equip at any time during the game. 

Hints:

- Get Rid of Music -
To get rid of the music, simultaneously press B and Start at the title screen. You have to reinput the code each time you lose a life.

- Invincibility -
Enter the following code at the Title screen....
Up - Down - Left - Right - A - B - Up - Down
Then when you play the game you will be invincible
