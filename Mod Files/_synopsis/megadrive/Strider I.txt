_________________________
You're Strider, a crunching hulk of muscle with a grappling hook and laser sword. You're in a future land of backward time, and its evil Master is taunting you with defeat.

Can you survive 8 megs of incredible danger? Hang-glide into the citadel, then clang your hook into metal to stiff-arm up to safety. Stay alive by slashing armies, winged robots, and prehistoric monsters into shuddering heaps! Battle alluring Amazons who sling vicious boomerangs and drum out a war chant to turn your mind manic.

Slide, duck, and cartwheel past lasers, spikes and bombs. Screech to a halt in the face of giant metal monkeys and centipedes. Feel your biceps burst as you grapple with snarling musclemen. Cling to battleship bulkheads. Leap from Tyrannosaurus Rex. It's Strider! The Master awaits!

Hints:

- Get 3 Continues -
During the opening screen press,
A, C, B, C, A, Start

- Infinite Continues -
In order to get infinite continues, first put in the Genesis game "Altered Beast." As soon as the title screen comes up, pull the game out of the system (without turning it off). Then, put in "Strider" and reset the system. To check to see if the trick worked, go into the option mode. If you cannot move with the directional buttons (meaning if no option is highlighted yellow in the option mode), then the trick worked. Play through the game, and you can use as many continues as you need to beat the game.
