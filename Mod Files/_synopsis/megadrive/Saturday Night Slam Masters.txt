_________________________
It's Saturday night and the Slam Masters have arrived! Ten of the biggest and beefiest wrestlers ever to step into the ring have gathered for one bone-crushing, back-breaking tournament where there are NO RULES! Step into the ring and get ready for no-holds barred wrestling as you bounce your opponents off the ropes and clotheline the fools! Or dare them to take the fight outside the ring where brawls with tables, chairs and bottles are all part of the action. And just when you've got enough muscle, grab a friend and try out the sinister Death Match, where only the ultimate Slam Master can survive the barbed wire ropes and the booby-trapped floor!

Directions:

Wrestling is an easy enough concept to understand. You try to pin your opponent for 3 seconds to win the match. However, this is an objective which will make this game a whole lot of fun.

To be able to pin your opponent, you need to beat on him until his energy bar slowly drains down to nothing and then knock him down, afterwards attempting the 1-2-3. If you can do so, you win the match. However, if both opponents fail to score a pinfall in the time given in the match, the player who has the most health remaining is declared the winner. If both have the same amount of health in an occasion, then the match is considered a "draw."

In a match, you will probably need to break out the whole arsenal of moves to win. Some moves consist of running. In order to run, you have to double tap either left or right to charge in the respective direction. Whether you bounce off of the ropes or hit your opponent, the directionals will lead you there. If you bounce off of the ropes, however, you gain another level of speed. Another technique that takes a little more time to master is the art of grappling. To be able to pull this move off, you must be standing next to your opponent and then hit the right and attack buttons. You can now either pull off either an Irish Whip (a throw at the ropes) or a body slam, depending on which button you press.

Gameplay:

The original Slam Masters plays like a traditional wrestling game, only the game used a view similar to that commonly used in the fighting game genre. The game uses a three button configuration (grab, attack, and jump).

Each character has two special attacks: a non-grappling technique and a finisher. When an opponent's life meter is depleted, he must either be pinned for a three-count or forced to submit. Defeating all of the other wrestlers results in winning the championship belt, which must then be defended against the entire roster.

There are two game modes: Single Match, where the player fights in a series one-on-one matches against the CPU; and Team Battle Royale, where the player and another partner (controlled by another player or by the CPU) competes in a series of two-on-two matches. The game can be played by up to four players.

Controls:  

A Button: Attack, Pick up a nearby weapon
B Button: Jump
C Button: Pin
Start Button: Pause game

Hints:

- Increase the damage of your moves -
Pause the game right as your move lands, doing this will add to the amount of damage it inflicts.
