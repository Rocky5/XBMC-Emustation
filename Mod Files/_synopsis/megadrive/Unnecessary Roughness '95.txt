_________________________
Join broadcaster Al Michaels for the one of the roughest, toughest football games ever played. With all of the NFL teams and more than 1,400 licensed players, UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS has all of the excitement of Pro Football including blind-side sacks, goal line leaps, and some of the most brutal tackles outside of professional wrestling. With two dynamic camera angles, the game takes on the feel of a television event, and digitized player cards provide a cool way to look at stats. As the name would indicate, there's a High-Impact option that pushes the action to the extreme, so get ready to hear some bones crunching when Junior Seau gets fired up. Save all of your game progress with complete battery backup.

Gameplay:

UR95 is your average football game featuring both single plays against the computer or a friend, and full-fledged seasons, including playoffs and Super Bowls.

The main attraction to the game however is a "Construction Set" option which allows you to create everything for your own team, to your playbook and tournaments. You can even do your own team's logo and import/export your creations to trade with your friends.
