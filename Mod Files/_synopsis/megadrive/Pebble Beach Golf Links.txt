Now you can golf on one of the most famous courses in the world with Pebble Beach Golf Links for the Genesis. Licensed by the Pebble Beach Company, the game features 18 holes of fairways, greens, bunkers, cliffs, water traps (including the ocean!), sand traps and other staples of professional golf. 

Five gameplay options are available: Practice, Skins Game, Stroke Play, Match Play, and Tournament Play vs. 48 Top Golfers. You can create up to ten players and change the names of the fictional pros to anything you want. A battery backup saves stats, such as tournament scores, longest drives, putts per round and much more.

You can choose from 14 different golf clubs. If you need advice, you can rely on your caddy to suggest the club with the most appropriate range. A power meter lets you hit the ball at the desired strength and height, and along with your stance, determines whether you will hit the ball straight, to the right or to the left. Wind speed and direction and the lie of the ball are also things that you should consider when preparing to hit the ball. 

Other features in this game include instant replays, a leaderboard, green grids (for help in aiming putts), hole fly-bys, and multiple camera angles.

Trivia:

Pebble Beach has been rated as the number one rated public golf course in America. It was the site of the 1992 U.S. Open.
Golf videogames have been popular since Golf hit the Atari 2600 in 1980.
