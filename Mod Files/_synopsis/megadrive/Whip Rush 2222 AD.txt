In the year 2222 AD, three exploratory spaceships departed our overpopulated solar system with the goal of finding new worlds to colonize. Five years later, the ships were listed as "Missing and presumed lost" with their last transmission: "We are approaching planet Voltegeus..." Less than a week after the incident, a massive alien vessel materialized in the vicinity of Mars and was heading towards Earth.

Gameplay:

Whip Rush is a side-scrolling (with certain vertically scrolling descents and ascents) shooter similar to Gaiares and R-Type.

You start with 3, 4 or 6 ships depending on the difficulty level you select.

In addition to moving and shooting, your ship has Power Claws that you can rotate and extend for offensive and defensive purposes. Power Claws can be equipped up to two units and can shoot bullets.

The upgradeable weapons are Laser, Missile, Fireball and Power Claw.

Laser is forward firing only but is rapid and strong, missiles can shoot back and forth and when shot from the Power Claw they will home in on enemies. Fireballs shoot in the opposite direction of your ships travel.

Unlike most other games, your ship has variable speed, which comes in handy when negotiating different kinds of obstacles and enemies.
