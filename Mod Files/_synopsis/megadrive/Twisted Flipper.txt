Endorsed by heavy metal hair band M?tley Cr?e, Cr?e Ball: Heavy Metal Pinball features instrumental versions of three of the band's most popular songs: Dr. Feel Good, Home Sweet Home and Live Wire. Despite their involvement with the project, the members of Motley Cr?e never make an appearance in the game.

This vertical scrolling pinball simulation is composed of nine similarly designed volumes (levels) of play, each with bumpers, gates, spinners, bunkers, ramps, bonus multipliers and more. Each volume consists of an upper screen, a middle screen, and a lower screen.

In addition to shooting for targets and other staples of the pinball genre, you must kill skeletons, maggots, killer clowns and other heavy metal monsters. Your most formidable battles may be against Craig, who is "Keeper of the Wall." In each level, the Wall, which stands between you and the Volume Knob, must be torn down in order to "Crank it Up" (advance to the next level).

After cranking it up to level nine, you must face Mr. Gore, the spirit of ANTI-METAL. To win the game, you must shoot the ball into Gore's mouth three times.
