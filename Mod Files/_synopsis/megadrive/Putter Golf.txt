Like mini golf? Then this is the game for you. It plays much in the same fashion as many billiards titles, with you manipulating the ball's path through a cursor and then deciding how much force goes into each hit. As this is putting only, many of the courses are very complex and offer lots of challenge. As golf games go, it's not all that bad and is a decent way to spend some time. I don't see this one offering too much trouble as a download, and the lack of a two-player game is questionable. Games like this work quite well online, and Putter Golf would probably have run pretty smoothly, since lag would have essentially been a non-factor here. Question: Is this title related to the Game Gear Putt & Putter Golf?
