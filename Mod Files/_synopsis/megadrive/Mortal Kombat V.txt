This one is definitely the oddest of them all. Mortal Combat 5 (as it reads on the title screen) is an attempt to re-create the Playstation game Mortal Kombat Mythologies on the Genesis. All sprites in this game have been ripped out of previous Genesis Mortal Kombat games (I assume Ultimate MK 3 was used). You control Sub-Zero and battle through sprite-swapped variations of Kano, Sonya or Liu Kang, running through levels which are visually designed to resemble their Playstation counterparts. The backgrounds constantly repeat themselves, which makes the maze-like design of the stages irritatingly hard! Also, there are a lot of cheap instant-kill deathtraps in this game that increase the insane base difficulty even more (the difficulty settings in the option screen seem like a bad joke). However, this game is strangely compelling, so you keep playing nevertheless even though you know it'll only frustrate you.

In theory, the whole thing is rather short and incomplete (it apparently ends abruptly after stage four), but it certainly doesn't feel that way!
