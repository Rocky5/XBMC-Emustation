_________________________
In an hour the princess must decide: marry the Grand Vizier Jaffar or die. You are the only one who can save her, but you've been arrested and thrown in the dank dungeons far below the palace where the princess nervously waits in a room at the top of a tower. You escape the guards' clutches, but you have a long way to go to rescue your true love and depose the cruel tyrant who rules his land with an iron fist. To get there, you'll have to leap across bottomless chasms, avoid spikes which shoot up from the floor, and battle nasty swordsmen.

Played in real time, Prince of Persia gives you exactly one hour of game time to master its secrets and reach your objective. Using animation modelled after the movements of real people, creator Jordan Mechner has crafted an intriguing game which not only looks wonderful, it has the feel of an old adventure film, with you in the title role.
