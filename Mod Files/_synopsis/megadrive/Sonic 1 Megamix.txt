_________________________
Highlights for version 3.0:

- All level layouts edited (some complete; others pending)

- Each character now has a unique set of moves (though Sonic and Shadow share homing attack)

- Most levels (not all) have a small intro, ala S3K, where they perform some sort of action when starting the level. i.e, running in from the left.

- Loads of music edits

- There is now a "preferences" screen, where you can customize certain aspects of the game (suggestions are welcome)

- Cheat codes have been changed - figuring them out will grant you access to a new, special level select (which is a bit buggy - just don't hit left/right on zone selections =P)

- "Original Mode" allows you to play the original levels from Sonic the Hedgehog, using all of the additions from Sonic Megamix (such as bugfixes, moves, preferences, etc). There is also a seperate save slot for a character's original mode.

- Title screen demos have been edited. Credits demos have not.

- Super forms have been added.

- Elemental shields, ala S3K, have been added.

- Credits have been edited; each character has a unique end pose on the ending sequence.

- Various other changes. See the Wiki page for more info.

This is, pending future changes, considered a "complete" release. Future changes are planned, but not assured. More information can be found on the Manual/Wiki page, located here: http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_1_Megamix
