_________________________
Go for the Gold in this multi-sport release based on the 1996 Atlanta Centennial Olympic Games. Like earlier video games representing such sports, including the Konami arcade classic Track & Field, the control scheme is based on rapidly pressing two or three buttons to make the onscreen athletes perform.

Many field events are featured in Olympic Summer Games, such as Javelin, Discus, Long Jump, High Jump, and even Pole Vault. Track events like the 110 Meter Hurdles and 100 Meter Spring races are included too. Hand-eye coordination is tested in Skeet Shooting and Archery.
