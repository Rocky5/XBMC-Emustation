_________________________
This is a map edit for the original Metroid. Screens, enemy and item placement, palettes, text... you name it, it's been changed. The primary goal was to make the game more playable - the discerning player will note the careful placement of platforms and enemies to make jumps easier. Not that beating the game will be a cinch. The items are much more difficult to get, the corridors are contorted into winding mazes, and many of the energy tanks have been completely eliminated. Beating this version will be fun but it will not be effortless.
