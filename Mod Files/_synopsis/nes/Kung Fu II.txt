_________________________
This is the sequel to Kung-Fu, the oldskool game we all know and love. Except now, you're not a guy that has to save his girlfriend... In this game, you're a police officer that goes and fights crime using kung-fu!

Which makes no sense if you take into account part one's story.

Visually, the game's pretty good. There are little cutscenes between levels where you get messages via a communications unit, either from your friends or someone else *cough*. You fight on top of a subway, on a flying airplane, a mansion, a ship... oh, and you also fight a gorilla. Not since Bad Street Brawler had a game dared to put you against one. And this time it doesn't suck!

Except of course that Circus level boss. Oh sure, you can drain my entire life in three seconds, and my punches don't hit you? Bastard.

Translation Description:

As I said above, this is the sequel to Kung Fu. This game was considered unhackable until occluded hairdo and parasyte proved otherwise.

All the text is translated and a nifty title screen ripped from part one was inserted for all you retro-freaks. There are some issues with some of the grammar in the dialogue [see screenshot #2 for an example] but there are no real spelling errors, and it just adds to the 80's cheese. Thumbs up for such a great job!
