You've heard about PREDATOR, the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie - now you can play the leading role! Take a crack commando unit into the South American jungle to rescue a bunch of trapped diplomats. Should be easy enough... and so it would be, if it weren't for the mysterious alien who keeps on taking out your men!
