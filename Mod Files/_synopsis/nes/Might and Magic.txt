Might and Magic is your basic RPG dungeon crawler. Your sole purpose is to uncover the Secret of the Inner Sanctum... whatever that is. Really, your sole purpose is to run around killing monsters and gaining levels. There seem to be little or no plot points to guide you or indicate your progress through the game.

That's not to say it isn't a great game. For those of us who like this sort of thing, Might and Magic gives us just what we want. Classic Dungeons and Dragons style stats and combat, lots of exploring to do, and plenty of monsters to run into all the while. The graphics are pretty good, if a bit basic. The monsters are somewhat recognizable, although there are more monsters than there are different images to distinguish them. Overall, a good game of its kind, and Might and Magic was one of the originals, and started quite a strong series. if you're not too worried about absence of plot, give this dungeon crawler a try.
