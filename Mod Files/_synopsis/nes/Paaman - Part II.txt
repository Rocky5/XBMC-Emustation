_________________________
Paaman (or quite possibly Parman) is a comic in Japan which is done by the same guy who did Doraemon. Like that wasn't already obvious just by looking at 'em. All of the four characters that you have the choice of controlling have the amazing ability to fly in an amazingly awkward fashion. I don't think there's any difference in who you want to pick though. What's awkward about flying is, if you're flying Up and want to go Left, you don't just automatically go Left when you hit the control pad... you go diagonally, then you go left. And you don't sit still if you let go of the control pad, you have to hit A to stop. And then you have to hit A again to fall to the ground and walk around like normal. Which is all very weird. But you can jump REALLY high, so that's cool.

Translation Description:

Well there doesn't look like there's much text in the game (aside from the usual crazy prologue), but it all looks very very nice. And it's finished!
