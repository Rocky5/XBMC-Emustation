"The year is 2525 and the planet Earth is in peril. Its destruction is imminent unless you stop an attacking force of evil alien space stations. Riding inside Vindicators, the most powerful battle tanks ever created, you must infiltrate each station and destroy its control center. Roam every level of each station in search of fuel, battle stars (used to customize your tank) and keys (to leave a level and enter the next) - all the while repelling fierce courtier attacks by enemy tanks, turrets, mines and flying saucers."

"Vindicators" was a pretty big arcade hit. It was a lot of fun on the NES as well. I don't think the graphics were as good, but they never are. The controls were a little slow, but it is still fun to play. I think it's a lot more fun if you have a buddy to play with. Vindicators is a lot of fun so give it a try.
