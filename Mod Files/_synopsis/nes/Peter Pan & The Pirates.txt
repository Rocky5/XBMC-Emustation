Neverland. That magical island where dreams come true and children never get old. Home to mythical tree fairies and beautiful mermaids. The most wonderful place in the whole world. "Wonderful, indeed," thought Captain Hook, the wickedest pirate on the seven seas, "but not for long! When my crew of cutthroats is done ravaging the island, Neverland will be mine at last. Then, I'll have my revenge on that litttle pest Peter Pan!He'll walk the gangplank before I'm through!" Now you can help Peter Pan rid Neverland of the evil pirates and destroy Captain Hook once and for all! But hurry! There's no time to lose!
