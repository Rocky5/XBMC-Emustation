Overview:

Al Unser Jr. Turbo Racing is a typical driving game. You get to race an Indy car. The thing that stood out in this game was the responsibility of shifting gears. Most racing games do it automatically. While it was pretty much some of the same old same old, it was still fun. The graphics were well drawn, they reminded me of Rad Racer. The audio was pretty annoying because there were a lot of sounds that sounded like white noise. The controls were responsive, which is essential for a racing game. This is a high action racer worth taking for a spin.
