Ai Senshi Nicol is an Action Role-Playing game, developed and published by Konami, which was released in Japan in 1987.

Note from Rx: This is not the offical FDS version of the rom, but an unlicensed NES port.  It plays better on the NES with faster loading times and less drag, so I chose this one to be in the set instead.
