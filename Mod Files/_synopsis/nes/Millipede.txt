You are lost in a dark, perilous, and enchanted forest. Dark dangerous mushrooms push up through the squishy forest floor, snaring you on every side. Something slimey flashes through the mushrooms, moving in on you. The MILLIPEDE, not a normal size one, but the gigantic monster, is attacking you. All you have to fight back with is the magic arrow. Shoot his head to turn him into mushrooms. But that is not the only thing attacking you. There are more creepy, crawling, buzzing, swarming creatures in this forest. Keep fighting with your magic arrow. If you are lucky, you may survive. Watch out, here they come!
