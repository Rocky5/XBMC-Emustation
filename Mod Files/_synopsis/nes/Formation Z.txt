_________________________

The player competes in a marathon continuous scrolling horizontal shoot-em-up game across land, sea, air and outer space. You can hold down the fire button for a burst of Charged fire, which is especially essential to defeat the bosses.

The player can hold down the Jump button to transform back and forth between a Mobile Robot or an Aero Fighter. Some sections have confrontations on both ground and air; others insist on aerial battling. Your time in the Aero Fighter is limited by its fuel requirement.
