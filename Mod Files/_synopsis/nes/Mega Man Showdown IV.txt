_________________________
Mega Man Showdown IV is the boss-only version of Mega Man IV that makes all stages except for Cossack 1, and Cossack 2 only 2 screens. Wily 3 are where you refight old bosses.

All boss stats have been edited (EX version only), all weapon energy consumption amounts have been edited, except music.

This should be the final version of Mega Man Showdown IV of v1.00 unless bugs are discovered. Also note that Mega Man Showdown IV you start with 0 lives which is new in this Showdown series and you get to choose between Normal and Hard modes depending what patch are you using.

The EX version of Mega Man Showdown IV brings more life to the game. All Bosses are customized to be stronger and harder to defeat meaning that they're hyperactive and the hard mode version patches simply won't give you any reflex time after getting hit.

The original showdown series is created by Vagla of Dragon Eye Studios.
