Just Breed is unlike any strategy RPG I've played, which, considering the amount of strategy RPGs I've played, is not really saying that much! You know in most strategy RPGs you're dumped into a predetermined setting, and there's a bunch of monsters around, and you're given a goal of some kind (like DEFEAT THE MONSTERS! or PROTECT THE PRINCESS!), and when you win you're all yay, and you go on to the next predetermined setting.

See, though, in Just Breed you can run around towns and talk to people and stuff. It's JUST LIKE A REGULAR RPG! Amazing! But! When you go outside and into the overworld, it goes into a strategy RPG setting, where you move a set number of squares, and attack enemies in a straight line from you, and such. Once the enemies are all defeated, you can run around on the world map to your little heart's content. Very nifty.

Your group is divided up by generals, and each general has people that follow him or her. One of the things I really like about Just Breed is that experience is distributed evenly throughout each group, and not individually like usual. Yay, no more of that constant character-juggling so no one ends up weaker than the rest! This is a huge deal to me.

So, as far as the very short list of strategy RPGs that Spinner 8 enjoys, Just Breed can be easily added to the above list, omigosh what a weird sentence.

Translation Description:

If you downloaded an earlier patch from somewhere else, be sure to get the new one that fixes a menu crash later in the game.

So this translation is awesome. Bongo's hacking work is second to none, and Shih Tzu's script is a joy to behold. If you have a problem with this translation, then you are a prick and no one likes you.
