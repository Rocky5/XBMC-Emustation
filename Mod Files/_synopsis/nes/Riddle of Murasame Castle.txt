Game Review (By Spinner 8):

You're a samurai. You throw a lot of things though, which to me would make you more akin to a ninja. Maybe you're a samurai-ninja hybrid. Or! You're a ninja, disguised as a samurai! Very clever, those ninjas! There's no real plot, so you're just fighting for no reason. Maybe you're out to reclaim your ninja clan from the evil hand of your rival. Maybe you're out to avenge the death of your entire clan by your twin brother in your rival clan. Ooh, or maybe your master was killed! And you have to avenge his death! My my, I love ninjas.

Anyways, you fight, like, thousands of other ninjas, and you can throw things, like shurikens, or knives, or some kind of fire thing, at them. And if you get close enough, you can attack them with your sword. You can even deflect most projectiles with your sword! Pretty badass! The first part of the stages consists of you fighting in the countryside. The second part is in the castle, where you fight even more ninjas, kill the boss and, I assume, liberate the surrounding area.

Ummm, that's pretty much it.

Translation Description:

Everything is complete! And doesn't that title screen rock?
