Sail the seas as a bloody Buccaneer! Capture enemy ships, plunder coastal towns, dig for buried treasure, rescue lost family members, form alliances with colonial powers, even marry the governor's daughter!

Directions:

As you may gather from the preceding description, this game has it all. It's an action-strategy-sim-rpg if there ever was one. And there was, and this is it. It includes a life-spanning career for your pirate alter-ego, ship-to-ship battle, over-land battle, sword duels, all manner of quests, a gold-hungry, blood-thirsty and sometimes mutinous crew, winds, tides, rocks, reefs, fencing, fighting, chases, escapes, miracles, true love... wait a minute, I think that was The Princess Bride. Anyway, it's all here, too.

Hints:

Special Skills
You are asked at the beginning to choose a special skill for yor hero. These skills can really affect your game so it helps to know what they do: Fencing helps you win duels, and can turn the tide if you take on an opponent with a stronger crew than yours. Navigation helps you move around the map faster, and maneuver in ship combat. Gunnery improves the aim of your cannon, which can be very important. Wit and Charm will help you make alliances, get better rewards for helping local officials, and of course the ladies will fall all over you. Medicine will kep you healthy and strong so that you don't get old and decrepit and forced to retire early.
