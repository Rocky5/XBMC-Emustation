Who knew a game about food could be interesting? Before you can even say kawahagi(filefish) or fugu (blowfish), you too can become an enthusiast of the culinary arts of Japan. You won't have to watch Iron Chef to know the difference between foie gras and ankimo (monkfish liver). Follow the exploits of Shiro Yamaoka with the help of intern Yuko Kurita to find the best entr?e for the Tozai Publishing 100th Anniversary banquet. Enjoy this translation which has been lightly enhanced for playability (no MSG!)
