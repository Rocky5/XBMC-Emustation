_________________________
This is a recreation of Mega Man 9's Endless Stage for Rockman 5. It is an endurance mode, screens are picked at random, you must get through them and reach a teleporter to move on to the next set of screens. Some of the screens are made from parts of the game's original levels, some are completely original, and others are based on screens from previous Mega Man games. After so many screens you will face a boss. You start with all the master weapons and adapters in this hack, your only goal is to survive for as many screens as possible.

The version number on this page is based on the time stamp attached to the patch in the archive, as there is no official version number and the hack is updated often.
