_________________________
If Excitebike had a sequel, this would be it. It even looks the same, aside from the 3-dimensional aspect of it. Yeah, you don't just move continually to the right; you actually go around a track. Kinda like RC Pro-Am, except Motocross Champion has bikes and actually is a good game. Up and down control the, er, position of the wheels. Like you know, wheelies and stuff. And left and right steer. Be sure to remember this, because if you don't you'll be running into every wall you see. Actually, you'll be running into every wall you see anyways. But that's not to say that it's a bad game. It's fun, and everyone should play it, so there.

Translation Description:

Everything's translated. Whee! You might notice a lot of the racer's names are (obviously) made up, but it's not really that horrifying of a travesty. Hell, game companies do worse things to their OWN games.
