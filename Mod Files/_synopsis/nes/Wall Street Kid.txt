_________________________

Wall Street Kid is nearly as exciting as Wall Street. Probably because, Wall Street isn't all that exciting either. But, it does have some uniqueness to it and is the only game I know of its kind. If you love text then you'll love this game. Other than that it is rather bland!

Directions:

You are given $500,000 dollars and set loose on the stock market. Your goal is to gain enough funds to pay for a new home and to eventually have the family home and maintain its heritage. Along the way you need to spend money on other things such as cars, gifts for Pricilla, and other expenses that come your way. Get enough money to buy the family house and become a successful stockbroker!
