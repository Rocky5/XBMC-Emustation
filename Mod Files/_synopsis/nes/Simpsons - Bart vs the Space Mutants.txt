Hello, fellow humans! Bartholomew J. Simpson here, with a very important secret: SPACE MUTANTS ARE INVADING SPRINGFIELD!

That's right, man! A buncha slimy, horrible, totally gross and putrid monsters are taking over the bodies of the people who live here and they wanna build a weapon that's gonna take over the entire planet!

Pretty cool, huh?

Anyway, yours truly is the only one who can see 'em 'cause of my X-Ray glasses - so it's up to me to stop 'em! I've gotta spraypaint things, get radical on my skateboard, use my trusty slingshot and in general, behave like a nuisance, man.

Plus, with evil dudes like Nelson the bully and Sideshow Bob getting in my way, it's a good thing I've got the rest of the Simpsons to help me out! So if you're a decent person, a patriot and somebody who cares about this sorry planet, you'll do the right thing. Save the Earth! PLAY THIS GAME!
Thanks, man.

--From the NES Simpsons: Bart vs. the Space Mutants instruction manual.

Overview:

You are Bart Simpson, and you must stop the Space Mutants from invading Springfield! The Space Mutants plan to create a machine that will help take over Springfield, but this wont happen if you, Bart Simpson, can paint or hide all purple items before the Space Mutants can find them!

Directions:

In this side-scroller game, you are to hide or paint anything that is purple, but you must be careful and not to touch an alien, because they will hurt you if you do.

Controls:

A Button: Jump/Run
B Button: Spray Paint
Start Button: Selects Menu Item
Select Button: Scrolls through Menu Items

Hints:

Access Sound Test
In Level 1, stand to the right of the 'E' on the 'Quick-E-Mart' sign. Shoot one of your rockets at the 'E' to make a Krusty Clown Face appear that gives you three extra lives and a Sound Test.
