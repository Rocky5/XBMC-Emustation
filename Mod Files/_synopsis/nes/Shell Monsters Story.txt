_________________________
Yet another Dragon Warrior/Quest clone. In this, you take the role of a generic hero... who wears a shell on his back; I assume it's a turtle shell. And you have to look for three other beings (monsters) that also have shells on their backs so you can all save the world.

So yes, it is a generic RPG storyline. The game is a generic RPG. The battles are quite tough, though. The first few fights will be frustrating at the very least, because even the weakest enemies need at least three turns -each- to be killed, and you start the game alone. The music's decent, and the graphics are kinda simple when you're in the overworld, but the monsters look allright, and they change a bit when they're almost defeated.

Translation Description:

This is a complete translation aside from a few minor graphical glitches. It uses the Namcot 106 mapper (iNES mapper #19). The patch works only on the properly dumped Japanese ROM. I believe this is Kaijyu Monogatari (J). You will need to expand the Japanese ROM from 256KB to 384KB before applying the patch. Consult the readme for further information.
