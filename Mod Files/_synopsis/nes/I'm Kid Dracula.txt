God, I suck at this. I can't even beat the rollercoaster bit in stage 2 for chrissakes! But, um, yeah. This is sort of a Castlevania game, but it really isn't. It's a sidescroller featuring a cute midget version of Dracula as the main character. You go through levels throwing fireballs at stuff, and jumping over stuff, and, uh, stuff.

You can charge your shot by holding down the fire button (and the Kid gets this evil little grin on his face); this seems to be the only way I've found of getting Coins, which are needed to play the minigames. The only one I got to try was the "One Shot" game, which had a little Skeleton-T lookalike sticking out of a trash can, or something, but I didn't get to see what it was about because I didn't figure out the weapon-charging thing 'til I got to stage 2, and as I said earlier, I never made it past the rollercoaster. Doh. Also of note is that you can aim your fireball up by holding "up" on the gamepad. I didn't figure this out until about halfway through stage 1, and two of the three bats in the first hallway nearly killed me 'cuz I didn't know this. Doh, again >_<

I don't know what the plot behind this is, unfortunately, because there doesn't seem to be one in the stage-and-a-half that I played. Maybe something kicks in later, but as far as I can tell, the Kid got woken up and he's pissed at whatever woke him up, so he throws a temper tantrum and goes bonkers on anything that gets in his way. And falls off of rollercoasters. And gets thrown off of clouds by witches and buzzards. And dies a lot. Doh.

All in all, this is a pretty cool game, I just suck at it. FUN!

Also, please note that this game has some really nasty emulator issues, so refer to Kit's readme for the full story.

Translation Description:

Everything's done, whee! It's a pretty good translation, too, even if it does break the game in NNNesterJ :/ The Konami code works in version 1.03.
