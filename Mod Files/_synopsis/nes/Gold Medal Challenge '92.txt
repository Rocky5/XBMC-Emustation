Gold Medal Challenge '92 was a 1992 video game by Capcom. It was an Olympic sports game loosely based on the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. It heavily relied on button mashing style games. This game is also notable for its capability to have 8 human competitors to compete in the Olympiad concurrently against each other (although only 2 at a time).
