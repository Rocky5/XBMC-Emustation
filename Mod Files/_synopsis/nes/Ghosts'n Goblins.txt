Our beautiful Princess is kidnapped. Her lover, the Knight, armed with five different weapons, must pass through seven guarded gates to successfully rescue the princess.

The Knight needs your skill to rescue the Princess to cunningly maneuver escapes from Hades, land of the enemies.

--From the NES Ghosts 'n Goblins instruction manual.

Overview:

Save your girlfriend from the demon (Asutaroto) that kidnapped her in the middle of your picnic. Not much of a story, true, but that's not the point. The point is, this is a really fun game.

Ghosts 'n Goblins was a pretty good conversion from the arcade game to the NES. The enemies are well drawn and tough. The sound in this game was pretty good, with only a couple of annoying ones. Overall a very good effort by the folks at Capcom.

Directions:

This was probably the hardest game ever made for the NES. You get two hits per man, and you only start with two men. To top it all off, you have to make it through the game twice. The enemies surround you and and they'll drop down on you from above. If that wasn't enough, some of them have ranged weapons. Although, there is a myriad of weapons you can get to help you on your way: torches, javelins, swords and axes. Altogether it was a fun game, but I wouldn't try to beat it, it will consume you like fire through a dry wheat field in a high wind.
