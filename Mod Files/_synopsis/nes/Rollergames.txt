Get ready to be rocked, rattled and rolled!

Short on funds for a worldwide terrorist blitz, the underground criminal organization VIPER (Vicious International Punks and Eternal Renegades) has infiltrated RollerGames - the most popular sport of the 21st century. With their greedy sights set on the games' mega prize money, they've corrupted three skating teams and abducted the games' beloved commissioner, Emerson "Skeeter" Bankhead. Now, somewher beneath the city, he sits bound and gagged, at the mercy of these cowardly creeps.

The CIA and FBI lack the speed, cunning and sheer brute force for this job. So it's up to you and your own three teams of free-wheeling skate wizards to rescue the commissioner and stop VIPER from unleashing its venom on the entire city. This is one fight that cannot be fought like a gentleman. You're going to have to take it to the streets, the sewers, the junkyards - just about any place your eight wheels can go (and even a few places they can't).

But even your cat-like reflexes won't guarantee success as you choose and lead your teams through the six muscle-aching stages, all peppered with dastardly deathtraps. Open manholes, greasy oil slicks, combat helicopters and blood-thirsty dogs are just a few of the dangers that await you.

Of course, you'll also have to punch and bodyslam your way pas chop-happy judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and more.

And considering the odds of survival, now might be a good time to hang up your skates and bow out gracefully. But remember, the lives of thousands are hanging in the balance. And if you choose to accept this job and fall flat somewhere along the way, you can count on VIPER to roast your ball bearings for dinner!

--From the NES Roller Games instruction manual.

Overview:

Roller Games is kinda corny, but it's still pretty fun. You have to roller skate around while fighting bad guys, dodging manholes, and jumping large gaps. The controls are simple and the graphics aren't too bad. They are almost just like Contra's graphics. This game also shares it's sounds with Contra. Coming from Konami what do you expect? Roller Games is moderately amusing and a good way to kill a little time, if that's what you're looking for.
