_________________________

The game features a cat hero named Pero. He's on this great adventure to save the world. But in the Wild West? This will not be an easy-peasy adventure.

Directions:

As you go through the game, you see that you'll be using the gun most of the time. You can change the weapons, however, at the bottom of the screen. How? Pause during play and switch weapons using the left and right buttons! Again, this is a side-scroller. You can kill baddies, collect pickups and whatever, and plain just mindlessly venture! Have fun!

Controls:

A Button: Jump
B Button: Shoot weapon
Start Button: Pause Game
Select Button: Switch between New Game or Continue
