_________________________
This is an infuriating puzzle game. It wastes no time in holding your hand through the first few, you know, letting you understand the game's intricacies. Therefore, all of these screenshots are from the game's first level, cause I really don't want to bother with it. The manual included in the zip doesn't help either. Well anyways, all the screenshots look different because you have three different "themes" that you can use. I like the ninja cause he crawls around and he's funny. Hahaha! That's all.

Translation Description:

Seeing as how no one has ever beaten this game, like, ever, we can only assume that the game is completely translated. So yay.

Update: There are Kanji's in the ending that are left untranslated.
