_________________________
With a game so simple, there's not much to be said about it. You just run around and kill people with your ninja stars, and you can get a boomerang later on. You can probably get more than that, but I can't be too sure. Other than the really crappy control, Ninja Boy 2 is a really fun game. All the first one had was a bunch of vertically scrolling levels I think. The sequel tries to add a platforming aspect, and it doesn't really work. Basically, it just ends up being you and the enemy hurling shurikens as fast as you can at each other until someone slips up. Usually you. Still, cool game. Old, and quickly tiresome, but still pretty cool.

Translation Description:

I think all Toma needed to translate were a couple sentences. But those sentences were translated marvellously, let me tell YOU!
