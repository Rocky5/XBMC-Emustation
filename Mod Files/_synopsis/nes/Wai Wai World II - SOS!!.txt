Yep, more crrrazy super-deformed fun from the fine folks at Konami. But where's Solid Snake? Why did my character just turn into a baby? What the hell kind of game IS this?! Well in all honesty, it's a bunch of games just kinda smashed together. There's some Twinbee action going on, and a little Gradius, and a lot of side-scrolling stuff. Thankfully the crappy scrolling in the first Wai Wai World is done away with, and the game's a whole lot easier. It's still pretty unfair sometimes, like why some small little piddly-ass green thing does three hearts' worth of damage. It confuses me, which is why this game is cool. Kind of. Ummmm, yeah.

Translation Description:

All (most) of the instructions you need to play are in the readme, not like it's too difficult to figure out, but have fun! Version 1.01 fixes an untranslated graphic.
