Welcome to Slime City

They're back! Kookie old Ma Fratelli and her slime-ball sons have returned to wreak havoc in your neighborhood. And this time they've not only kid- napped your Goonie buddies, but your good friend, Annie the Mermaid, as well. What a bunch of low lifes, this Fratelli Gang.

Now it's up to you, the last Goonie left, to save the day. But it won't be easy. You'll have to be a quick thinker and a fast tracker to pull off this mission - you'll have to be a regular Super Goonie to succeed! So good luck, and good riddance to Ma, her boys, and all the scuzzy cohorts awaiting your adventure into the Fratelli zone.

--From the NES Goonies 2 instruction manual.
