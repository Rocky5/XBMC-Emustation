A sinister alien power has taken control of the Earth's military forces. Chosen by fate, you are the only person that the interstellar demon creatures cannot posses. Engage enemy infantry as you gather additional armament. Infiltrate a besieged city to secure the heavily guarded munition factory and nuclear reactor. Engage bizarre creatures from the scorching desert to the dark and forbidding forest. It's a race against time, and your time is almost up!
