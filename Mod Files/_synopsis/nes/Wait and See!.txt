At first glance, it may look like a bugs bunny rip-off, but it is actually a bootleg game loosely based off a Russian cartoon called "Nu, pogodi!". The sprites, however, are based off loony toon characters.

The game sucks. For an attack, you do a spin thing, similar to the tazmanian devil. When you jump, the game slows down, making it frustrating every time you have to jump. Bad controls, and bad jump psychics make this game freaking hard to beat. Not only has no one heard of this pirated game, little have ever beaten it. This game is so bad, and so frustrating, that I was screaming my head off while playing this awful game.
