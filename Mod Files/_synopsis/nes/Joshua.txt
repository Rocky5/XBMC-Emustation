You, Joshua, must lead God's people into the Land of promise. But watch out! There are falling rocks, soldiers, battering rams, and elite forces that will try to block your every move. Sounds challenging? You bet! God has given you the power. Weapons like the horn of Jericho, God speed, power-ups, secret exits, and other armor will help you in your quest. Conquer the Canaanites, Amorites, and Hittites as you collect silver and gold, race through deadly mazes, and defeat the enemies of God. So grab your sword and shield and step into the battlefield. The challenge awaits you!
