In this pool game, you get to play pool on the moon, hence the name, Lunar Pool. This game is a lot of fun, and was one of the first pool games on the NES, so if you like pool, give Lunar Pool a try!

Directions:

The goal in this game is to knock the balls into the holes. You need to hit them with the cue-ball. On the moon, you can decide what you want the friction on the pool table to be. Be sure not to put it too low, or it will be super hard not to scratch. There is also a plethora of different pool tables on the moon. They come in all shapes and sizes. The object in the one-player game is to make all the balls on the table in the least amount of shots possible. You get more points for each ball as you make them in a row.
