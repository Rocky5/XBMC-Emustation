_________________________

A couple is getting married at a wedding chapel, but the wedding is ruined when a bat comes over and turns the groom into a frog. The two dwarfs from Don Doko Don are called in, and are told that they must find a potion that will turn the groom back to his human self.

To do this, you must go through five lands infested by wildlife. Like the original game, you are equipped with a mallet, which can be used to smash enemies. You can then pick these enemies up and toss them at others. When you do this, they leave behind a gem that can be collected for points. During your travels, you can break open chests that contain goodies such as scrolls, extra energy, and more weapons.

You exit an area by entering through an open doorway, but some doors are locked and must be opened with a key. At the end of each land, you encounter a boss that requires quite a number of hits to kill before you can proceed to the next land.
