In case you've never seen the show before, this game involves the adventures of Baloo and Kit, two bears delivering cargo for Rebecca, another bear. However, Shere Khan, the evil tiger tycoon, wants to put Rebecca out of business, so he hires pirates, led by Don Karnage, to do his dirty work. Baloo has to deliver his cargo across the world while fighting the pirates who are trying to stop him. Anyways, the game usually has you control Baloo in the Seaduck, his plane, except for when you enter a bonus level, where you then control Kit on his airfoil.
