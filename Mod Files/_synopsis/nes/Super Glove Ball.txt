I had just started my repair work on the Allied Space Agency spy satellite, when I was caught in a dimensional rip in space. All outside contact has been severed. Without spacesuits or weapons my only hope is to use my jet-powered robo-repair glove to try to find a way out of this drifting maze in space.

I can't help but wonder whether this maze is a freak of nature or created by some alien race to test my intelligence. I have tried to break out, but nothing seems to work. The robo-glove is useless against the walls of force around me. There must be a way out.

Balls of energy seem to form out of thin air and float around this insidious space trap. I tried to hold one of these balls, but couldn't hold it for long. However, I have learned to hit these floating balls to break holes in the force field surrounding. I am now moving onto the next level. Who knows what new challenge will be waiting for me?

Spacedate: August 18, 2005.

There are things alive in here, strange things I've never seen before! They're trying to destroy me. So far my only defense seems to be hitting them with energy balls. My glove charges are getting low. I don't know whether I'm going to make it. This may be my last entry.
