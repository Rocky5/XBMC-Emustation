A totally radical game entrenched in a deep underground maze of never-ending pipes. Here is your big chance to try out those plumbing skills. The water is on, think ahead, and most of all, keep on your toes. Nasty accidents do happen! The general idea is to keep the water flow happening by adding the most appropriate piece of pipe. Well, it sounds easy enough, but the pace gets pretty hectic as the water stream picks up momentum. You may want to use a cross pipe, straight pipe, points pipe or try connecting a storage tank along the way to slow things down while you try and catch your breath. Don't relax for too long or the only breath you'll be catching is underwater. The minute you thought you were done with this floor, here comes the next floor, just a little faster. Watch out... a totally addictive game!
