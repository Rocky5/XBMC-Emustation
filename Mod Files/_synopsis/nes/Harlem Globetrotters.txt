Those international superstars of basketball, the Harlem Globetrotters, are here! Now you can play with 1, 2, or 3 friends, or against computer-selected opponents, and perform the antics made famous over the past 65 years by the irrepressible Clown Princes of Basketball.

Choose to play as a Harlem Globetrotter or face off against them. In either case, you'll combine awesome basketball skills with high hilarity. It's unpredictable! It's unequaled! It's an action-packed entertainment treat for "kids" of all ages!

Hints:

Special Pass: Pressing Select with a direction button will create a behind the back pass which is quicker than the normal pass. It seems to get interecpted by the computer more often though.

Slam Dunk: When on a clean break if you are running and you press B to take a shot, and you happen to be at the correct distance from the net, your player will make a slam dunk that sends the crowd in cheers.

Piggy Back Slam: Unknown at the moment. I'm trying to figure this out. If you have any info please email me and I'll put it in a FAQ update.

Pull Down the Referee's Pants: During a jump ball if you press B or A at the correct time right before he throws up the ball, your player will pull down the referee's pants, and get the ball automatically.

Trip the Referee: When a free throw has been called, the players will run down to the key area, and the ref will run by, a well timed B button will send him to the floor.

Ball on Elastic: Happens only when your taking a free throw. Unknown to me at the moment. See Piggy back slam.
