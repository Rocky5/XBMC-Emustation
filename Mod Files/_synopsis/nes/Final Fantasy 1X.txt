Final Fantasy 1X changes the appearances of the characters in battle and makes some of the useless weapons, armor, and magic better. It also gives the black belt/master class his own set of skills.

Here are some of the changes, take from RPG Man's website:

Weapons:

- Falcon Sword (renamed from Falchon) can be used by FI/KN/TH/NI/RM/RW.

- Power Staff has been renamed Golden Staff.

- Vorpal Sword has been changed to the Sage Staff.

Armor:

- Allowed the BB/MA to equip the ProCape.

Magic:

- LV1 - FOG has been replaced by PURE and LOCK has been replaced by KICK

- LV2 - LAMP has been replaced by ABLT (Aura Bolt)

- LV3 - LOK2 has been replaced by FDAN (Fire Dance)

- LV4 - PURE has been replaced by CHKA (Chakra)
