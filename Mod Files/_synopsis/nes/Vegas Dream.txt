Bring a casino home to your living room! Up to four high-rollers can play Blackjack, Roulette, Keno, or Slot Machines. Odds are you are going to love VEGAS DREAM!

Storyline:

You, along with up to three friends, are setting off on a trip to Las Vegas. Once you get there, you will be given a stake of $700.00, with the chance of increasing it to $1,000,000. You can challenge your friends or the house in Blackjack, Roulette, Slot Machines, or Keno.

In the course of playing the game, you will be approached by all kinds of people - players looking for side bets, hustlers looking to take advantage of you, chances for romance, strangers with hard-luck stories. You will have to size up each encounter and decide what would be to your best advantage.

So will you realize your dream of making the big money, or will you have to return home penniless.... only time and fate will tell.
