_________________________
Softball Heaven plays just like every other Nes baseball game. Except this one is actually fun because you get to play as all sorts of strange animals, mythical figures, and whatnot. You can even be Mike Tyson! Also, there are a bunch of different fields to play on, each with it's own house rules. Softball Heaven is about as fun as baseball is going to get on the Nes, so you should give it a shot. But then again, Sunday Funday is about as fun the Bible is going to get on the Nes, so I guess that isn't the best reasoning ? aw hell, just play the damn game.

Translation Description:

Can you imagine having to translate all those stupid names? Bleh. Anyway the game's complete, even though the title screen kinda sucks.
