In this episode, DIG DUG's job is to protect peaceful islands. But as in the original arcade classic, his arch rivals POOKA and FYGAR come burrowing up to lay waste to his tropical paradise. With his great intuition, DIG DUG has prepared for the impending onslaught by driving spikes into the ground and readying his trusty drill and inflator.
