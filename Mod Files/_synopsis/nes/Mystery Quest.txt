And strange creatures prowl the castles, ready to pounce upon you when you least expect it! But you will find magic powers hidden along the way, to help you in this Mystery Quest. The magic talismans you seek are the greatest gifts known to man: wealth, wisdom, happiness, and peace. Go now, complete your quest, and prove that you are as great a wizard as I!"
