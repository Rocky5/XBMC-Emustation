_________________________
This is Kunio's first outing on the NES, which some of you may know as Target: Renegade. (shock, horror) This is pretty close to most other Kunio fighting games, but this one has the special distinction of having Kunio not being able to kick in front of him. Good old Technos. This game is hard, so don't bother kicking up the difficulty. The "hard" setting for the game is really just plain unfair. Then again, I do suck at old-school fighters.

Translation Description:

Apparently this was a quick and easy patch, and there's not really much to rate except the nice title screen and the fact that what text there is in the game makes sense. Hurrah! By the way, I suck mightily at this game, which you may be able to tell from the fact that the only proper gameplay shot is on the first screen.
