Spin the Wheel. Buy a Vowel. Solve the Puzzle. If you're not familiar with this concept then you've been asleep for the past 25 years.

Directions:

As a faithful reproduction of the idea of the TV Game Show, this is pretty good. But as a video game it's a bit, well, not so good. Graphically, it's behind the times even for when it was made. Vanna is a horrible monster in a horrible pink dress. The Wheel is round in the sense that it doesn't have corners, but it's pretty far off from circular. Don't bother playing against the computer. If you play on Easy your opponents are completely illiterate, if you play on Hard they already know all the answers, and if you play on Normal, well, it's purely a game of chance.

Controls:

Start Button Start Game
A or B Button Choose Letters, Spin, Vowel, Solve

Hints:

-Spin Strength
The strength of your spin doesn't affect the game in any discernible way except for the time it takes to stop. So to keep the game moving use low strength, because the high strength spin will keep that wheel moving for about an hour.
