_________________________
This ROM hack is for those of you who already own Final Fantasy and found that it wasn't as polished as it could have been.

I have taken the liberty of "improving" upon this marvelous game, correcting as many of Nintendo's stylistic errors, graphical censorships, and mistranslations as possible. However, truth be told, Nintendo did a very good job translating Final Fantasy1. At least there were no "This guy are sick" lines. Even so, the script was rather bland and important words stuck out like a sore thumb (ORBS and LIGHT WARRIORS come to mind). By using a more optimized DTE scheme, decapitalizing 90% of the text (^_^) and streamlining the tile table (which took a lot of effort BTW!), I found that there was not only plenty of room for a full trannslation, but there was room for more! Since my Japanese skills aren't all that great yet, and since no one on the face of this planet would dare dream of translating the script for me, I decided that I would simply rewrtie the American script, putting my personal interpretive "spin" on it. The result is, I hope, a script that is more cohesive, entertaining, and logical than the original.

Please keep in mind that EXTENSIVE liberties were taken with the hack. Do not think that Nintendo cheated you out of all this information. I have heavily researched Final Fantasy I, and sought to expand on very minute, almost insignificant details. In essence, you are getting a condensed version of the story that will appear in Final Fantasy Silver.
