_________________________
This is an action/adventure sidescroller. Indeed a classic style, and the NES was pretty hot on sidescrollers, and this game proves that!

You're some long-haired guy stiffed into a white suit who can fire blasts of holy power from your hands! Isn't that cool? It would be cooler if your holy blasts had unlimited range, by the way.

Well, you can use some magic too. It costs you ( of course ) some MP to use them. You start with only a ''Double Fire'' kind of spell; it fires two blasts of holy power at once, and these can cross the whole screen. You get more magic from beating the bosses at the end of each level, whose effects range from a very useful ''Blizzard'' spell, that not only freezes up enemies but also turns lava into ice, to a ferocious ''Thunder spell that kills everything on the screen!

There are also nifty magic like a power bracelet which lets you break some blocks with your holy blasts, magical boots which makes you jump higher and a cape which allows you to spend half MPs on your spells.

You can also turn into a dragon in some areas in the later levels!

The levels are somewhat short, but nicely done overall. There's a whole bunch of ORIGINAL enemies - thank goodness there are no palette-swapped enemies in the whole game! Great point.

My only complaint on the gameplay is that the game is one player ONLY.

STORY

Ahh! I dunno the story of this game. There's NO introduction screen, and I bought the game without a manual - even if I had the manual, it would be in Japanese so I wouldn't understand a thing - and there seems to be NOTHING on the net about this game so...

GRAPHICS

The visuals on this game are good, although they could be a lot better. Some backgrounds may look a little bland - they could've been more colorful. And your dragon form could be a whole lot better. But most areas look just fine. The enemies and bosses look good, and so do you in your white outfit.

SOUNDS

I really liked them music from this game, and I'm sure you'll too. Awesome tunes will accompany you through the whole game, and boy do they fit the game... I really loved the boss music you'll just have to play the game to see what I'm talking about!

And the sound effects are also awesome, very crisp and clean.
