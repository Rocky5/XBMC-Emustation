Sumo wrestling! Everybody loves it. This game (the video game, at least) involves you mashing buttons in an attempt to throw the other guy out of the ring. What do the buttons do? I do not know. Play the game anyway.

Translation Description:

This is one of those gaijin-hating games, where all of the text is displayed vertically. And, most of it's kanji, which Toma didn't translate. So the smallish percentage of stuff that IS done is kinda hard to read, cause you have to tilt your head to one side and stuff. Anyway, all the hiragana is translated, all the kanji is not.
