_________________________
While using the Warpman engine, this ROM hack is supposed to be a "spiritual successor" to the original Battle City game. While it appears to have Battle City graphics, it mostly follows Warpman rules and thus people must treat it as a Warpman game in disguise or "floating tanks in outer space."
