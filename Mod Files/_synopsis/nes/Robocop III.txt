Everybody's favorite cyborg cop returns to the Nintendo in ROBOCOP 3. The OCP has deployed Rehab Officers to wipe out Old Detroit in preparation for the erection of Delta City. Now it's up to RoboCop to join the fight against the Rehabs and save Detroit from total destruction.

As RoboCop, you have a newly redesigned suit which includes a multi-weapon arm attachment that has a large-bore cannon and a smart bomb as you take to the streets and make Detroit safe again. You'll face hordes of ED-209s, tanks, heavy artillery, and OCP's newest weapon: OTOMO. The entire city is counting on you, RoboCop, to clean up the streets and restore order.
