Dr. Gangrene is trying to conquer the planet with an army of Killer Tomatoes. Only the all-American boy, Chad Finletter can stop him. Luckily, Chad gets some help from his friends: Wilber, Tara, and Fuzzy Tomato. He is going to need their help if he is going to defeat the likes of Zoltan, Ketchuk, and the Gang of Six. Explore the streets of San Zucchini, and try to stop the ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES.
