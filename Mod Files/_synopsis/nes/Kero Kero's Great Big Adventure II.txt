_________________________
This is one helluva a neat platform game. You (yes, YOU) are the great and mighty Kero Kero Keroppi. You see, one day, all the people of Donut Pond were playing the game, when from the monsters inside the game took over Donut Pond. How sad. So Keroppi alleviates everyone's fears and sets out to kick some monster ass.

The game is your standard-issue Nes platformer. You jump around from platform to platform, and kill various enemies by jumping on them in the time-honored platform tradition started by Super Mario Bros. You can also kill stuff by shooting at them. "With what," you ask? Why, with musical notes (and, if you get enough power ups, with Keroppi's very mighty name). The interesting thing with this game is that instead of confronting you with a boss that acts just like all the other enemies in the games (except the bosses take three jumps to kill instead of one), you are confronted with a boss that challenges you to one of a variety of mini-games.

On top of all that, the graphics are ruley. (BTW, if you like these games, check out the Wagyan Land games. Exactly the same thing, except instead of Keroppi, you control a Gon/Godzilla looking thing).

Again, the translation is complete, and I have nothing to say here. Um, Sanrio is cool.
