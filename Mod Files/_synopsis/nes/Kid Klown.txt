Kid Klown in Night Mayor World (sometimes shortened to Kid Klown) is a platform game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in April, 1993. It was developed and published by Kemco. In Japan, it is known as Mickey Mouse III: Dream Balloon.

Kid Klown was originally a Mickey Mouse game in Japan. Released as part of the mostly Game Boy Mickey Mouse series, Mickey Mouse III: Dream Balloon was released in September 1992 by Kemco in Japan for the Famicom. Due to copyright issues, it was changed to Kid Klown in Night Mayor World for its US release.

Other games in the series include Kid Klown in Crazy Chase for the Super Nintendo and Game Boy Advance, the Japan-exclusive Kid Klown in Crazy Chase 2: Love Love Hani Soudatsusen for PlayStation, and The Bombing Islands for the PlayStation.

Story:

Kid Klown and his family are on their way to perform in a circus when they meet the magician Night Mayor. He asks Kid Klown to help him open a treasure vault, but Kid Klown, having been warned about the evil magician by his parents, refuses. Not willing to give up so easily, Night Mayor kidnaps Kid Klown's family and dares him to follow him into his world if he ever wants to see his family again.

Gameplay:

The player character, Kid Klown, carries balloons with which he can attack, jump higher, or float. There are seven (including the introduction level) different-themed levels throughout the game, and at every end of the level is a bonus stage where he can collect extra lives and extra energy.
