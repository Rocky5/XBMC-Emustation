Blegh.. Well I played this for about a minute before giving up. It's a strategy game, set in space, and that's pretty much enough to turn me off. Overlord has scarred me for life, I'm afraid. There's probably some cool fighting and stuff, but it's just too much effort I think.

Translation Description:

This patch isn't quite complete, but you won't notice any gibberish until about four or five hundred hours into the game. Give or take. That's literally, according to blibber.
