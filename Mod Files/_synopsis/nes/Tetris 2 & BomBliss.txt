Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.

As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.

Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.
