Wally Bear is a member of the NO! Gang. This gang is no normal gang. It works like a youth support group. They help each other get through life's rough spots that deal with drugs/stealing/alcohol/peer pressure etc. You must navigate Wally from his home to his Uncle's house for a party. You will meet up with many friends along the way. This guide will chronicle the interactions between Wally and his friends throughout the journey.

Overview:

Wally Bear and the NO! Gang is an educational Nintendo Entertainment System game that teaches children to say no to potentially harmful drugs like tobacco, alcohol and marijuana. It is notable for being one of the many NES games that were not licensed by Nintendo, most likely because the game's content did not comply with Nintendo's Content Guidelines that were in power at the time of the game's release. The game was designed in cooperation with the American Medical Association and the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information. Like in most early platform games, even getting hit once meant losing a "chance" to beat the game.

The game was originally going to be called Wally Bear and the Just Say No Gang, but Nancy Reagan had trademarked this phrase. The Wally Bear Hotline provided by this game, 1-800-HI-WALLY, was still active as of 2006. However, it was finally disconnected by October 2007; 15 years after the game was released.
