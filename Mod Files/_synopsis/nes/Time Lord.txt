It is the year 2999, and warriors from the planet Drakkon are launching a savage attack on Earth. Their weapon: a powerful time travel device. Their objective: to control us by changing the course of our history. To win this war, we must meet the Drakkons on a unique and dangerous battleground: our own past! You are a fearless fortune-hunter, hired by desperate scientists for an experimental journey into the 4th dimension. Your code name is Time Lord. Your mission: blast into the past to save the present from certain doom! Battle the aliens in four historical time zones. Search for weapons sent back by the scientists - and decide when to use them. Solve puzzles to collect the mysterious Orbs that hold the secret of time travel. Be cautious yet quick, Time Lord. You have one short year to free history or be history! And the evil Drakkons have all the time in the world...
