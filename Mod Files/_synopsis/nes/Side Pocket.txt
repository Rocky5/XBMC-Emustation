Side Pocket is probably the best pool game for the NES. It is a lot more like real pool than most pool games on the NES, like Lunar Pool. You have a series of levels to clear, and a number of trick shots to preform in order to beat the game. Once you get the hang of it, it's not too hard. This was the first pool game for the NES with the ability to put english on the ball that I ever played. Side Pocket is one of the best pool games on the NES, so if you like pool, be sure to check this out!

Directions:

Play the best game of pool you can.

Hints:

English
The english in this game is a little touchy, so be sure not to put that much.
