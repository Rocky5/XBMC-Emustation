Trivia:

Both the Japanese and U.S. versions of Kickle Cubicle feature a cameo by Kid Niki: Radical Ninja. To see it, hold down the A button on Controller 2 and then turn on the game. Continue holding A until the title screen appears, and Kid Niki will appear.

The Japanese version tends to have more enemies present in the various levels.
