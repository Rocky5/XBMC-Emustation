Wrestlemania. The biggest wrestling event ever. Only the best succeed. Play as many legends and show 'em who's boss!

Featured wrestlers:

- Hulk Hogan
- Andr? the Giant
- "Macho Man" Randy Savage
- The Honky Tonk Man
- Bam Bam Bigelow
- "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase

Gameplay:

All wrestlers possess a limited amount of moves, which comprise of basic standing punches and kicks, headbutts, a running attack, a move off the turnbuckle (Andr? the Giant can't do this), and a body slam (Bam Bam Bigelow and Honky Tonk Man can't do this). All wrestlers also possess a "back attack" that they can use on an opponent standing behind them (usually a backwards punch). The moves themselves are somewhat tailored to each wrestler (Randy Savage, for example, uses elbow smashes instead of punches, while Bam Bam Bigelow has two running attacks instead of one). The wrestlers cannot leave the ring and can only execute turnbuckle attacks from the bottom two corners. Sometimes, while a wrestler is being pounded on, they will turn red, indicating anger. An "angry" wrestler can inflict more damage than normal while in this state. Sometimes during a match, an icon will come on screen that a wrestler can pick up to gain health. The icons are unique to each wrestler (for example, Honky Tonk Man's looks like a guitar, while Hulk Hogan's looks like a crucifix) and cannot be used interchangeably (wrestlers can only pick up their own icons).

Players can either play a single exhibition match (one player versus the computer or two players head-to-head) or a tournament. In a single player tournament, the player chooses one wrestler and must defeat the other five in a series of matches to win the championship. In a tournament with two or more player-controlled wrestlers (up to six can play), each wrestler faces every other wrestler once (fifteen total matches). At the end of the tournament, the wrestler with the best record wins the championship. In the event of a tie, the wrestler in the tie who achieved the single fastest victory during the tournament will be declared the winner.

Trivia:

-The 2008 film "The Wrestler" features a game graphically inspired by WrestleMania, with similar looking characters and the missing front ring ropes.

-It was the first WWF licensed video game, meaning it featured actual WWF wrestlers as opposed to fictional characters like previous wrestling games.
