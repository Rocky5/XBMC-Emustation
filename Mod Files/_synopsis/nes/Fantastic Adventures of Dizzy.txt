Dizzy is this egg, you see, and the idea of the Dizzy series is that he gets in these silly situations (usually involving the kidnapping of his girlfriend) and he has to get out of them by solving puzzles and traversing the countryside while not getting hit by anything. EVERYTHING hurts Dizzy except, apparantly, falling hundreds of feet (he just lands on his butt and sees stars for a little bit in that case).

There are two versions of NES Dizzy. The first one was released in gold cartridge form in 1991, and the second one was released as an Aladdin cart in 1993. There are several differences between the two:

- Stars. The gold version has 100 stars; the Aladdin version has 250.
- Dizzy walks a lot faster in the Aladdin version, and the inventory system is a bit simplified - when you pick up an item, it goes as far to the right of your inventory window as possible.
- There are some small terrain changes, and some items are in different places.
