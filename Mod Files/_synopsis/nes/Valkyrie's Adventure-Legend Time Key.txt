_________________________
Okay, this game blows. I know that a lot of people spent a lot of time on this game (well not really), and I know that I should be nice and all (NOT really), but the game still blows. Think Hydlide with a sword. And better music. Okay, well it doesn't blow THAT much. You just walk around and kill stuff, and there's no point to any of it, and it's all just so bleh. It's got a day/night cycle, which is sweet, but there's no point to it, and it just goes back to day so quickly anyway, so it just ends up pissing you off. You might gain levels and stuff, and that character creation stuff in the beginning just MAY have some relevance to the rest of the game, but after about five minutes, you won't really give a damn, and you'll go back to playing your stupid Madden games.

Translation Description:

DvD was trying to play through the game, but all the issues with the current translation detracted from the experience. Since the game had very little text to deal with, he decided this well known classic Namco Action RPG really needed someone to give it a more accurate translation.

Our translation features:

- Title screen with translated title and subtitle

- Translated configuration and password entry screens

- In game "Danger" sign and start button popup translated

- "Ride the Ship" hint and "Exit" Inn/Shop signs in the ROM, but not in the game, were translated and put back in the game where they belong

- Cleaned up Engrish ending text

- "v" marks added to password on Inn screen to match those already on the password entry screen
