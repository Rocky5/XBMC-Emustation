"Willy" the rising young jazz cat in New York City goes by the stage name of "The Rockin' Kat." However, the local crime boss, Mugsy, kidnaps Willy's girlfriend, "Jill". To rescue his girlfriend and defeat the gangster, Willy must venture through seven different levels or "channels" (from a television set) that feature various themes, thugs and bosses.

Willy is armed with a punch gun, that he can launch at the various thugs in the game, or to hook onto and swing from in a manner similar to Bionic Commando. Willy can also use the punch gun to grab and throw certain objects. Mastering the punch gun is critical to success in the game.
