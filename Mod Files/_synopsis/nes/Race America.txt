If you've ever wanted to drive across the United States and get a different perspective on things, then RACE AMERICA is for you. Of course, you'll be driving at about 180 mph, so look fast if you actually want to see the country! In this nine-stage race across America, you'll be up against some of the best drivers in the world, and you'll compete in a wide variety of events, like drag racing and 100-mile jaunts. Watch out for road hazards and try not to spin out, because you'll have to run a near perfect race if you want to have a chance to win.

You'll race day and night through nine cities, viewing the action from a variety of camera angles, including the Absolute Helicam which lets you see the race from above. Whether against the computer competition or against a friend, RACE AMERICA delivers fast and furious action.
