Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is an action game released in 1988 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. After the 1984 film release, Atari Games released an arcade version of the movie in 1985. Nintendo of America sought to capitalize on both the success of its Nintendo Entertainment System and the Indiana Jones franchise by porting the game to its popular console, along with Atari's other arcade games like Road Runner and Klax, as well as third-party games like Ms. Pac-Man and Rolling Thunder. The resulting game differed somewhat from the arcade version, but kept the same underlying premise and style.

By December 1988, there were two versions of the game available, distributed by Tengen and Mindscape, although the software itself was identical. After a lawsuit, Tengen's unlicensed version was pulled from the shelves and Mindscape's became the standard. Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom gives the player control of Indiana Jones as he makes his way through the temple in a series of twelve levels or "waves." In the final wave, the player must defeat the villain of the film, Mola Ram, on a rope bridge that recreates the final scene in the movie. The game was almost universally panned by both contemporary and modern critics and game players, chastised for its poor graphics and the overall difficulty of gameplay.
