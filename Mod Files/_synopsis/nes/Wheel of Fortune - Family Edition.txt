Of all the Wheel of Fortune games on the NES, this one has to be the best. If you're trying to put together a good NES system with good games, controllers, and all the cool equipment, this game should be near the top of the list. Its music is an improvement (I think Rare had something to do with the music), the puzzles bigger, the prizes better, and you earn a lot more money. However, the graphics are no better and the game base is the same. It would have looked a lot like this if you were playing the original Wheel of Fortune. Overall, this game is a good one, and if you want a classic Wheel of Fortune game, I say give this one a try. The opening scene graphics are pretty cool too.

The exciting software version of television's number one game show has an all-new Family Edition! Now, everybody's favorite, Wheel of Fortune, has even more great fun: over 1000 challenging puzzles in both regular categories and new ones to give you even more great game play. You're the contestant competing against your friends or matching wits with the computer. You already know how to play... and it's your turn. Let the theme music inspire you and spin for a consonant or buy a vowel if you have the cash. If you're right, the pretty hostess will turn the letters. Do you want to take a shot at guessing the puzzle, or do you want to run up your score? Get set to spin, get set to win - the Wheel of Fortune Family Edition is hours of fun for the whole family!

Directions:

Spin a wheel and guess letters to solve a puzzle. There are things to stop you, such as Bankrupt and Lose a Turn. If you win the game, you get to choose a prize (however, in modern day Wheel of Fortune, you spin a smaller wheel, with a chance at 100,000 dollars, or some other nice rewards). After you choose, you have to pick 5 consonants and one vowel (I suggest you pick R,S,T,L,N,E, because those are the most common letters in a word, and in modern WOF, you get those letters automatically, then you get an extra 3 consonants and one vowel). Then it's up to you to solve the puzzle, with 40 seconds on the clock. Hit the "Play Now" button and get going.

Controls:
