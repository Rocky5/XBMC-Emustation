In this game, players can vie for the title of King of the Ring by competing in an eight-man single elimination tournament. Additionally, players can battle the entire roster through a string of singles matches to become WWF Champion. Also available are exhibition matches in singles and tag team modes for one or two players.

Each of the game's wrestlers possess the same basic moveset, consisting of punches, kicks, a body slam, a suplex, a throw, a dropkick, stomps, elbow drops, and a move off the turnbuckle. There are no signature moves. However, each wrestler varies in speed, strength, and stamina attributes.

Featured wrestlers:

- Bam Bam Bigelow (NES version only)
- Bret Hart
- Hulk Hogan
- Lex Luger
- Mr. Perfect
- Randy Savage
- Razor Ramon
- Shawn Michaels
- The Undertaker (NES version only)
- Yokozuna
- "You" - A generic character which the player can name and distribute attribute points for. When playing the title tournament with this character, his stats can be upgraded after each victory. Though limited, this is one of the earliest examples of a create-a-wrestler mode.
