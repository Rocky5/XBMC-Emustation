This is probably the first console game that only allows players to wrestle with a partner in tag team matches all the time! This kind of makes it one for those who are loners to stay away from, but it can be fun for anybody.

Directions:

You team with a partner to fight another team of two for a trophy! If you win the match, you get a trophy. If you win, the trophy gets bigger.

Controls: 

A Button: Grapple, pin, confirm maneuver, call in partner
B Button: Select manuever, tag in partner
Start Button: Start game, pause/unpause
Select Button: Select between 1 or 2 Players

Hints: 

Use your Tag!
Always switch between wrestlers so your wrestler get weakened enough to be pinned!
