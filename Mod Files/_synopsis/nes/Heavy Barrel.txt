_________________________

The impossible and unthinkable has happened. Terrorists have seized the underground control complex of a nuclear missile site. It's up to you to infiltrate the installation and eliminate the leader of the terrorist army. It won't be easy. Powerful tanks, treacherous waterways and the bridges are all part of enemy territory now.

The only weapon you'll be able to defeat the terrorists with is HEAVY BARRELL - but it's been dismantled and is in pieces inside the installation itself. Once you've battled your way inside, you must find the keys and reassemble the weapon. Brute force alone won't defeat the terrorists. This isn't a job for just anyone. That's why you are here!

Hints:

Continue Game
Select a 2-Player game, and when you begin playing, let the 2nd player die. Continue playing with Player 1 and when Player 1 loses his last life, play the game with controller #2!
