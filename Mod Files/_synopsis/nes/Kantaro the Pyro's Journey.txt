_________________________
Kanshakudama Nage Kantarou no Toukaido Gojusan Tsugi (try saying THAT three times fast) is the story of Kantaro, a guy with a ton of bombs, who's taking a trip across the Toukaido, the road between Edo and Kyoto. He wants to see his love, Momoko, but is she waiting for her?

For some reason, he finds himself assaulted by ninjas, swordsmen with baskets on their heads, and guys with guns (yeah, what the hell?) so he has to use his very own bombs to defeat them. Some are easy, but others require certain tactics which are difficult to perform, especially because of the way that Kantaro attacks. (It's not fun.)

This is a very fun platformer despite all its shortcomings (which aren't really shortcomings but more of the result of the genre still being perfected), and it can entertain you a lot if you can get past the troublesome control.

Translation Description:

The translation's pretty well done, especially considering the small amount of space that KingMike had to work with. Basically the messages between levels and other system messages were translated, as were some graphics in the game that indicate scoring and progress. It must've been a pain in the butt having to do all that with an 8-8 square, lemme tell you that.
