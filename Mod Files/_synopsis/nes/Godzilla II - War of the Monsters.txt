The earth is besieged by Godzilla and monsters, and is in a critical situation. Who will be the ultimate winner, human wisdom or the instincts of the monsters? A highly challenging yet simple simulation game to play!

Just choose the commands from the "pop-up" menu and all operations can be done easily. Concentrate on your battle strategy and destroy all the enemy monsters on the earth. Popular monsters are up against the newest "smart" weapons! As the commander of the Allied Defense Forces, you place those controversial smart weapons on the map. Fire and attack as you see fit. There are even some monsters that come to the aid of the Allied Defense Forces!

Monsters:

Godzilla: The titular and most common monster, and one of the most powerful. If Godzilla seeks out an H-Bomb, he will end the game. 

Baragon: A tunneling creature, special ability is to dig underground and become invisible, but he can be detected by a radar car. 

Rodan: A flying, highly mobile monster. Rodan can heal if he is over a volcano. Also, he will be weak if he's on the ground. 

Hedorah: A monster made of polluted slime. In water he is invincible and almost always, heal. 

King Ghidorah: Three-headed space dragon, possibly the most powerful monster. 

Mothra: A moth-styled monster, also appears in larva form. Initially an enemy, but in later missions becomes a friendly unit if the player finds its egg. 

Oodako: A giant octopus. Only appears in the ocean, never moves from its location, and is the weakest monster in the game. 

UFO: A UFO. Fires beams that can initially be reflected with the Super X2's laser, but in later missions is so powerful that it punches right through.
