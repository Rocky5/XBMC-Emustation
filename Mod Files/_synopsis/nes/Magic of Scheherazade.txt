The player controls a player-named hero who is a descendant of the great magician Isfa, who unsuccessfully attempted to defend Arabia from the evil wizard Sabaron. As a result, the Hero's memories are erased, and his beloved, Princess Scheherazade, is captured. Isfa must travel across five worlds to rescue Scheherazade's three sisters, her father, and finally Scheherazade herself. Along the way, eleven NPCs join the party to fight against Sabaron. 

Gameplay:

The majority of play takes place on an overhead map where the player moves between screens, as in The Legend of Zelda. In each world, the player must complete a number of tasks and recruit the area's allies, traveling between two eras of the world using the Time Gate found on a particular screen. Landscapes are numerous and include the tree-lined overworld, towns, deserts, underwater areas, dimly lit dungeons, and palace labyrinths.

The player's primary weapons are a sword, used for powerful close-range attacks, and a rod, used for shooting missiles that travel the entire length of the screen. Magic spells and items are also available for defeating enemies and negotiating obstacles. The character has three classes, a Fighter who uses the currently-equipped sword but who always uses the weakest rod (regardless of what's equipped), a Magician who uses the currently-equipped rod but uses a dagger instead of a sword, and a Saint who can only attack with the weakest rod and a dagger but who is required for certain tasks (like gaining the NPC Pukin in Chapter 3). Changing into specific classes is often required for other quests as well. The player can change classes (for a fee) at a Mosque or by casting the Great Magic spell Moscom during an Alalart Solar Eclipse.

Each chapter concludes with a demonic boss that must be defeated with magic and the rod.

Localization: 

The original Japanese version of The Magic of Scherherazade is a significantly different game than it's American counterpart. Everything from the music, graphics and world maps are extremely different from what Western NES players are used to. The music is simplified and sounds more in line with compositions from 1st generation Famicom/NES games. The graphics sport an anime influenced style to it, the protagonist has large round eyes verses the nondescript facial features of the American version.
