Tecmo NBA Basketball is a sports game for the NES. Although the controls may be a little primitive, it still brings excitement. It is rather a simple game once you get the hang of it. You start with 5 players on the field and 7 on the bench. It's always that way unless someone's injured. You can adjust the time, speed, and difficulty also.(Difficulty change is exhibition only.)
