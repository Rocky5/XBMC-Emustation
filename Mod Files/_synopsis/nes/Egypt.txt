_________________________
Egypt is an odd sort of puzzle game. You're this Indiana Jones-type lost in a tomb who gets swallowed up by a God entrapped in an orb (don't ask). Basically, this translates to you having to move the orb around on a grid, destroying various Egyptian idols. You accomplish this by moving the idols onto adjacent squares, which involves shifting entire rows and columns over at a time. It's sorta like a simplified Rubick's Cube with only one surface. It's pretty fun, though the game starts to entirely own you after the first dozen or so levels. Check it out.

This is now fully translated. Yay!
