G.I. Joe's squad of mean, lean combat experts moves into action! Cobra Commander has raised the ancient island of Atlantis from the ocean depths, and is using it as a base.

With a nearly indestructible army, and powerful space weapons, the power-crazed Cobra is about to take over the world! Advance through the lethal mazes of Cobra's weapons complex, battling soldiers, gunships, laser orbs, and skin-shredding birds of prey. Infiltrate secret storerooms where Cobra Commander carries out his deadly schemes. At each level, find an ally of even greater strength and skill to join your combat team.

At last, face Cobra Commander himself in a treacherous duel for world dominance! This is a fight only G.I. JOE can win!

Storyline:

Cobra Commander somehow survived the last time he fought the G.I. Joe team and this time he is plotting to use the long lost powers of the Atlanteans in his bid to rule the world. The game's format is similar to that of Capcom's Bionic Commando series with an overhead map of the various sub-stages, and bosses (Overkill, Cesspool, Firefly, Major Bludd, Destro) located at Cobra bases sprinkled throughout the game. Cobra Commander is the final boss at the end of the game once again.

Game Characters:

There are several playable characters in the game, each with his own unique style and abilities. Once players have discovered a character, they can 'decide' which characters will come with them, and alternate between them during gameplay by pressing the "pause" button and accessing the pause menu. Each character has their own agility, stamina and strength rating, although they are not shown unlike the previous game.

The playable characters available are General Hawk, Wet Suit, Storm Shadow, Road Block, Duke and Snake-Eyes.
