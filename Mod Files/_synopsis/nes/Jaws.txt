Based on the 1975 flick directed by Steven Spielberg, it's all about the Great White Terror of the Deep. You play a scuba diver who tries to stop the deadly shark once and for all.

Directions:

You start off sailing in a little boat, but soon you'll hit something and you'll have to go underwater to investigate. Use your weapon to shoot the underwater baddies and collect their droppings. You'll run into a couple of bosses, too. Once in a while, you get bonus rounds, which you drop bombs on the jellyfish in the water by a jet.

Controls:

A Button: Shoot weapon
B Button: Shoot weapon
Start Button: Pause/Unpause

Hints:

Jellyfish
Jellyfish attack from the bottom of the screen, attacking a jellyfish once will kill him, resulting in 50 points.
