_________________________
Mikhail Gorbachev, born March 2, 1931, was the last leader of the Soviet Union, serving from 1985 until its collapse in 1991. This game makes a joke that his master plan is actually to take over Japan and that he is going to do this by running a big oil pipeline from his oil fields in Russia to Japan.

The goal of the game is to complete a certain number of pipes from the blue liquid on the right side of the screen to the empty pipes on left. Some stages have less empty pipes and some have less water pipes from the right. Each level contains 9 stages. Each stage goes faster than the previous stage until you finish the level. In level 1 you have to make 2 pipes. In level 2, you have to make 3 pipes.

Two Russian children are the people who are building the pipeline. To make the pipes, you use tiles made out of groups of 2 pipe segments that the boy drops from the top. The segments contain straight pipe segments and 90 degree angle pipe segments

Translation Description:

I did this quick little translation to get me into the mood to work on translations again. harmony7 suggested the humorous subtitle. It's Compile's previous attempt to Puyo Puyo to make a Tetris clone, in terms of gameplay. As you've probably never heard of this one, it's obviously not as good. But, it is worth playing if you like these types of games.
