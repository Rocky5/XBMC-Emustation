Hop on your skateboard and get to church! Piece of cake, you say? Boy, are you in for a surprise. Not everyone wants you to go to church, and they're going to do whatever they can to stop you. So get ready for the ride of your life, and don't let go of your trusty Bible. It will keep you on the right path. If that doesn't wear you out, try your hand at Fish Fall, the fast moving flying fish game that will test your coordination while teaching you Bible verses to help you become fishers of men. Or, if you're in need of a little musical enjoyment, try singing lead vocals to "Ride of Life", the hot new song from Dove Award winning group of the year, 4HIM. Whatever your mood, Sunday Funday will keep you on your toes!
