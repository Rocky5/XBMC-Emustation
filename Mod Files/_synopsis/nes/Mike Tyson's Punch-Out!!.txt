Little Mac: A 17-year-old fighter from the Bronx in New York. He loves nothing better than a tough challenge.

Doc Louis: An ex-heavyweight who was a famous hard hitter in the U.S. around 1954.

It all began one day when Little Mac and Doc Louis met by chance. Doc became Mac's trainer, teaching him everything there is to know about boxing. Doc and Mac's story continues over a seemingly endless path, until one day a champion is born.

--From the NES Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! instruction manual.

Overview:

This is about as simple as it comes, ladies and gentlemen. Those of us who are old enough to remember, this game was the nifty when it came out. Spending hours with our friends trying to defeat these characters, Soda Popinsky is my favorite.

Nostalgia rocks!!!!! This game was released before Mike Tyson's famed ear biting incident. Back when he was untouchable. However, playing the game now, on the other hand, it's a bit easier to beat him (many more years of game playing will do that to a person).

If you played this game in the 80's, step back in time and play it again. If you haven't played it before, give it a shot just to give your StarCraft deserted eyes a break from reality.

Directions:

The game is simple...You are Little Joe. You fight. You win some, you loose some, but if you play it right, at the end you get to fight Mike Tyson (anyone remember him back in the day?)

Controls:

A Button: Right Punch
B Button: Left Punch
Start Button: Haymaker Punch
Select Button: Read Hints

Hints:

A little extra energy
Between the first and second rounds, if you press the Select Button rapidly, Little Joe will gain more energy for the next round. The faster you press it, the longer you press it, the more energy you will gain. It IS possible to refill completely.
