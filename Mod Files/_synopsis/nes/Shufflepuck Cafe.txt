I used to get a kick outta playing shufflepuck on the Macs at my High School, it was about the only "game" they had, so I grew quite addicted to it =]. Hence I love this game, seedy Sci-Fi plot and all.

If you're not aware what shuffle puck is, it's a lot like air hockey: there's a flat playing surface with a "puck." The two players sit at opposite ends of the table, and use a paddle to hit the puck back and forth across the table until it slips by one of the players, which scores them a point. This game is very good at re-creating that. In fact, too good . . . I can't beat a single person at it to be honest =P. It's almost like the computer is reading my moves!! If you happen to be addicted to shufflepuck against your will (like I was), you'll enjoy this game. If you like games that are virtually impossible to beat, you'll love it. Other wise . . . well . . . some things are better left unsaid.
