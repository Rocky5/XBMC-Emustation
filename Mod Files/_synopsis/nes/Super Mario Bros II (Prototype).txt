_________________________
An ever-elusive prototype of Super Mario Bros. 2 (US version unlike the first game or SMB2j). Once hoarded by so-called "collectors", this ROM image has recently been leaked to the entire world.

Contains even more similarities to the original Yume Koujou Doki Doki Panic (for the Famicom Disk System) than the final SMB2u does. Power blocks aren't animated, lamps instead of bottles, and a few other things.
