YEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAH! This game totally kicks it old-skewl! This second book of Falcom's classic Ys series is much like it's predecessor. It plays kinda like Zelda, where you run around various landscapes in an overhead view with real-time combat. Except it's cooler than Zelda because you actually have to charge through the enemy and run it through. The plot also has TONS of depth, even for an Nes game. The game also improves somewhat on the original Ys, by adding magic into the equation, as well as a larger arsenal of weapons, puzzles that are more difficult, and the fact that you can actually SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING in the dungeons. So play the game! Please.

Translation Description:

David and his anonymous friend did a wonderful job on this translation, and it's a great game, and I heartily recommend it. Now, if only someone would pick up Ys 5...
