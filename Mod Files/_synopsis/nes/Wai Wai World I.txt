Konami just kicks ass. Not only do they make some rockin games like Metal Gear, Castlevania, and Tokimeki Memorial (of course), but they even make some crazy stuff like this game. You take control of Konamiman, and you go around places and rescue characters from other Konami games, like Goemon and Simon Belmont and stuff, and then they become playable characters. Pretty freaky eh? Fortunately the game never takes itself seriously, which is definitely a good thing, since it's not all that great of a game. It's too hard! And what the HELL is up with the scrolling? It's not difficult kind of hard so much as it's an unfair kind of hard. Like, the scrolling. Or, little monsters jumping at you and hurting you when you first appear on screen, and even if you DID have time to react, you could do nothing to stop it. NOTHING. Why do people like this game? I mean sure, a bunch of Konami characters in one game is kinda neat, but the game is really bad! Just go and play their separate games, for God's sake.

Translation Description:

The one thing that really bugs me about this patch is that the whole reason for it is because Dylan thought that Demi's translation was inaccurate, and he decided to do something about it. Yet, Vic Viper and Twinbee have been changed to Dylan and Tina. Wha? Aside from that, and various abbreviations/spelling errors, everything is very well done, and much more verbose than the old Demiforce translation. A lot more things actually make sense, and stuff was added to explain things a little more. This doesn't make the game suck any less, but oh well. Anyway, all in all a great translation was made here. And give some respect to Tina, because the font owns you. Seriously.
