I started learning how to ROM hack in the summer of 1997, and by the next summer I felt comfortable enough to start working on projects with the intent of releasing them.

The first to be completed was this hack. Fresh from beating the FF3j translation, and amazed by the release of the original DOS version of Tile Layer, I decided to make Gauntlet into a FF3j themed game.

The graphics are mostly copy/pastes from the first three FF games, with some craptastic artwork done by myself as needed?

100% of the graphics and text were altered, but there's a problem with the way I did the wall graphics (You can't see the breakable tiles, which proves to be a major pain in the ass in certain levels).

Also, there is no level, sound or assembly hacking (All beyond my abilities at the time). However, the story is kind of interesting if you liked FF3j, as it's a direct sequel to it.
