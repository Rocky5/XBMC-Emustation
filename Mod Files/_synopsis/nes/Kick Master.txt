The kingdom of Lowrel is attacked and burned by the evil witch Belzed's troops of monsters. In the attack, the king and the queen are slain, and their only child, princess Silphee is kidnapped. The king's guards were all killed, except for the powerful knight, Macren. He and his younger brother, Thonolan, an aspiring martial artist, take off on a long journey to defeat Belzed. They start their long struggle in the witches' forest outside the kingdom of Lowrel. As the fight against the evil forces of Belzed commences, Macren is slain by a skeleton soldier. With his dying breath, he pleads Thonolan to use his great kicking powers to stop Belzed and his forces of evil and rescue the princess, Silphee.

The game has some RPG elements, such as leveling up.
