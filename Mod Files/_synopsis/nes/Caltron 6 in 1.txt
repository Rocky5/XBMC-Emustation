Trivia:

Soon after Caltron produced their 6 in 1, possibly due to some financial trouble, they sold their remaining stock to a Texas-based video game company called Myriad Games, Inc. Myriad Games re-released the 6 in 1 with their own label placed over Caltron's label, and with a new manual and box. Each respective cartridge and box of this re-release has a serial number, and the highest number found has been 888, according to the Digit Press rarity guide, making the Myriad version the rarest commercial NES game released in North America.
