It was an ordinary bright and sunny day, then something out of the ordinary happened, since, with that "Jovial Car," anything can happen! I'm not going to tell you everything. You better come with me to experience this once-in-a-lifetime trip. If you collect all the flags in a round, then you will advance to the next world. You can drive to the shopping mall for shopping, but don't forget to press your "Start" button before you make your purchase!
