After the game's release in late 1991, players had until noon EST on April 11, 1992 to practice beating the game. At this time, MTV revealed a secret password. By entering in this password and the game's serial number before beginning the game, players unlocked a secret "Prize World". After this, players had until midnight to complete the entire game including the Prize World. This prompted the game to reveal a 24 character code. By calling in to a special hotline with this code, players had a chance at winning one of 36,252 prizes.
