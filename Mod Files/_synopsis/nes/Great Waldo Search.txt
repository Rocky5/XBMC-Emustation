Whitebeard the wizard has lost his powerful magic scrolls. He asks his good friend Waldo to search the Realms of Enchantment to find them. Well, you know our favorite world traveler just can't resist a call to adventure, so it's off to the magic lands!

Now it's your turn to help Waldo in his thrilling quest across areas filled with giants, castles, dragons, crazy monks, monsters and much more! Find alarm clocks that give you a little extra time, Bonus Points that add to your score, and even Waldo's canine buddy who will take you on a magic carpet ride! All the fun and wild cartoons are here for Waldo lovers everywhere!

Gameplay:

In each stage the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. The game has three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and expert. The difference between the difficulties is the time given for each level (and "expert" has no clock refills to give you extra time).

The pictures are slightly animated images of Waldo scenes, the player has to scroll along the long picture to survey the scape while searching for Waldo and other objects. The directional buttons control a magnifying glass and is used in order to "find" objects. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each level and by finding him the player gets to play a small bonus game to collect points while controlling Woof on a flying carpet.
