_________________________

In this Arcade game the gameplay is quite simple, the hero, named "Milk" must get all the fruits in the screen in order to free his girlfriend (don't ask me what's the relation) who is captured inside of a house. Your rival "'Nuts" will try to keep you away from your goal. To obtain the fruit, Milk will climb up ladders and jump onto different platforms.

Points are earned by obtaining the fruit, jumping over Nuts and completing the level in the shortest amount of time (obtaining the Bonus score value). Two game modes are included as well as a level editor.
