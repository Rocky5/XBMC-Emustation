_________________________
People say that this is a lot like Mappy, but I've never played Mappy. But Mappy can't be as elite as Hello Kitty. Well anyway, your job is to water all the pots in the level until a happy lil fruit sprouts. Then you go to the next level. I know, it sounds terribly complicated. But the charm of all Sanrio games lies in their complexity. All kidding aside, not only can you water plants (press Down) but you can smack all the enemies that try to stop you (press B). They're only stunned though, which makes things tricky! In any case, the game kicks ass. Whether the Sanrio part adds to it or causes it, it kicks ass. It's a nice simple game to play when you're bored, and you end up playing for hours. So Play It.

Translation Description:

All that needed doing here was the title screen and some miscellaneous graphics. Needless to say, it didn't take long, Um, let's just leave it at that.
