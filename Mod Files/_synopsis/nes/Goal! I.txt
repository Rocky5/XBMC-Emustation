Gameplay:

The game has four modes: World Cup, Tournament, Shoot Competition, and Vs. Mode. The object of the game is the same as in real football; one team must score more goals than the other to win.

In World Cup mode, players must choose one of sixteen international football teams and compete to advance to the finals. The teams are: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Uruguay, United States, and the USSR. 

In Tournament mode, players must choose one of eight American teams and compete in a standard single elimination tournament. 

In Shoot Competition mode, players must choose one of three characters and try to score as many shots out of five as possible. 

In Vs. Mode, two human players face off against each other. 

When playing World Cup or Tournament mode with two players, the players can either play on the same team or against each other.
