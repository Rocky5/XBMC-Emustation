_________________________
What's been changed:

- Fighter => Rydia

- Thief => Butz

- B. Belt => Lenna as the "Monk" class

- RedMage => Cecil, Paladin

- W. Mage => Plain Lenna with a cape

- B. Mage => Butz (I think) as the "Black Mage" class

- The class-changed characters are original creations, so they are not from any other game, however they may slightly resemble their former selves in most cases.

- The palette for the 16-24 character sprites (the ones you control in combat) has been changed to better colors.

- Hammers have been replace by whips.

- The starting values for chars have been grossly inflated to enable you to progress throught the game at a faster pace.
