_________________________
In the early 1900's, a brutal series of animal rapes occurred which took a small rural town in China by storm. As quickly as the rapes started, they stopped and all was peaceful?until now.

69 years later, it's happening again. Animals are going fucking ballistic and rampaging in the streets. You must stop them the only way possible.. by raping them into submission! Seek answers as to why these animals are going insane and put a stop to it.

Features: All text is edited/replaced with comical and inane dialogue. All enemies are changed for the better! An all new story. Scenery is changed to fit the story. Main character's starting stats have been overhauled to prevent having to grind enemies for hours.

Enjoy!
