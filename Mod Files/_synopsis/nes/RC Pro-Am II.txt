_________________________

This second Pro-Am racing game for NES introduces some innovations compared to its predecessor. Once again, you have to bring your red radio-controlled car to victory, score points, hit turbo speed lines, and leave no chance to your blue, green, and yellow adversaries. But you can also upgrade your engine and tires - if you can afford it, which means you'll have to think seriously about gathering those dollar signs scattered on the track. The tracks themselves have more variety, some have unusual enemies (little planes bombing you from above), and more kinds of obstacles. You also have several lives and don't die immediately if you arrived last.
