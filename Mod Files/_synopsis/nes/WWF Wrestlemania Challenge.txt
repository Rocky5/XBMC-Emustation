This game features many of the WWF greats, such as Ravishing Rick Rude, The Big Boss Man, Andre The Giant, "The Macho Man" Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, "Hacksaw" Jim Duggan, Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake, and The Ultimate Warrior. You can go through a small career trying to become the WWF Wrestling Champion by playing as you. There are also one on one playdowns. Tag Teams of 2 Vs. 2 are also another option. The survivor series is where 3 wrestlers take on 3 wrestlers, and the last team standing after the other has been eliminated is the winner.
