Return to a mythical time in the Far East, when the legendary Siamese-Twin Shiva, God of Destruction, cursed your village with fearsome evil spirits. Despaired by repeated failures to drive out Shiva's evil demons, your best friend, Master Hu, has turned into a drunkard. You, Master Chu, must search through hostile palaces and temples to find and destroy this four-armed incarnation of Shiva. If you would like, just ask your teammate, the Drunkard Hu, to help out. Playing together can be a lot of fun!

Gameplay:

The game has 10 levels, or rounds, as they are called in the game. In the first 7 rounds, the player must collect 8 symbols of harmony (which resembled red and white yin-yang symbols) scattered throughout the area. Some symbols are hidden and may be found by shooting certain objects in the level. Successfully finding all 8 symbols will transport the player to the level's boss. After beating the boss, the player must then find the Flaming Key of Freedom hidden in the boss's room to proceed to the next round.

In rounds 8 and 9, the player simply fights a boss three times and is awarded the key. In round 10, the player fights two more bosses with Shiva in the background and after defeating them, Shiva is fought. Successfully defeating Shiva wins the game.

Both Chu and Hu have similar attributes. The player may fire shots of energy with the A button and can use a fan with Chu or knife with Hu with the B button that can defend against certain projectiles. The player may find various items that can restore health, grant invincibility, extra lives, or increase the number of shots fired.

There are numerous enemies and obstacles in the levels to harm the player. If the player has the item that increases the number of shots, being harmed by anything will downgrade this item. When all lives are lost, the game is over, but the player may continue an infinite amount of times. Continuing on any rounds past 7 will take the player back to the start of round 7.
