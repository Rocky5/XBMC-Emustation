An evil pterodactyl has kidnapped Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm. Luckily, Fred and Barney have found the kids; but, the pterodactyl will not return them until the two fathers bring the five legendary fire gemstones. You will have to use Fred's clubbing skills and Barney's sling to get through a variety of levels filled with pre-historic enemies.

The trip is a made a little easier by switching between the two characters and collecting power-ups that increase the effective range of each person's attack. When the levels are complete, special sports bonus rounds await the two heroes. Save the kids and make Bedrock a better place with THE FLINTSTONES: The Surprise at Dinosaur Peak!
