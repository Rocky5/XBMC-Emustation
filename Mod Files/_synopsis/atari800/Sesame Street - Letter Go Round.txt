The Sesame Street Muppets invite a child player for a spin on the Letter-Go-Round!. By catching and matching letters on a spinning ferris wheel, children practice recognizing and matching letters, simple spelling and word formation.

There are several types of game:

- Upper case matching; 

- Lower case matching; 

- Mixed case matching; 

- One little word; 

- What's missing?; 

- Spell the secret word. 

At the start of each game, one of Muppet pets brings out a letter to match or word to spell and drops it on the seesaw. A letter appears on each ferris wheel bucket and as the Letter-Go-Round spins, child player should find the right letter to match or complete a word. Child may choose and try any letter, because there is no time limit to play. When a match is made or a word is completed, Muppet pets will dance and cheer a child player to the next round of play.

The game is recommended for 1 player aged 3 to 4.
