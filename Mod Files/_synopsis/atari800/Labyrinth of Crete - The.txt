_________________________

Labyrinth of Crete is a graphical puzzle game based on Greek mythology. Uniquely for the time of the game's release, you control two separate characters. Jason and Hercules are on their quest to recover the Golden Fleece from the heart of the terrible Labyrinth, converging three unrelated myths into one.

The maze is split into three sections, each of which is vaguely mapped out on the back cover. Your success is by no means certain - tricks, traps and monsters abound. The game features hi-res graphics for some locations but is otherwise a text adventure.
