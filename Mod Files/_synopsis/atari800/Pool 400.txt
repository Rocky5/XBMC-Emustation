_________________________

Innovative Design has made quite a reputation for itself among Apple II owning gamers with its string of successful disks for that system. Now the company has enlarged its electronic pool hall to provide sufficient room for Atari computerists. Pool 400 packs much of the detail of IDSI's Pool 1.5 into an easy-to-use ROM cartridge for the Atari microcomputers.

The most exciting feature of this generally well-executed game is the "instant replay". When you send the cue ball into the side pocket with this game, you get a chance to try the whole shot over again. Too bad real-life pool sharks aren't quite that amiable about such things.

Pool 400 will be especially welcomed by those who don't have lightning reflexes. Good strategy and a sharp eye for geometry count far more heavily.
