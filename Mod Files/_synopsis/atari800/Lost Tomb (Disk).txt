Use the tape version as the disk release has a serious bug that crashes the game.

A conversion of the arcade title by Stern, Lost Tomb takes the player into the depths of an ancient pyramid, though its location is uncertain (the box covers place it in Egypt, but in-game it is said to be deep in the Amazon). To escape, you will need to make your way from chamber to chamber - uncovering treasures, avoiding traps, and facing a variety of enemies from scorpions and spiders to mummies and gigantic bats.

Like every self-respecting explorer and treasure-hunter, you've armed yourself with a gun and a whip: the whip clears away everything in your immediate vicinity - enemies, traps and even walls. Your gun can be infinitely reloaded, but whips are limited (though you can restock along the way). The pyramid itself dislikes your presence: if you loiter too long, or step onto a trap, the earth will shake and the walls will shoot!

Alongside the treasure chambers, each level of the pyramid has a stairway which takes you deeper down, with two different exits; fortunately, you're equipped with a map to help you plan your route. Beware the special throne rooms, rarely encountered and chock-full of traps.
