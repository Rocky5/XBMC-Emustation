River Raid is a vertically scrolling action game. You fly a jet up river in an attempt to destroy bridges which are vital to the enemy. The river is heavily guarded, however, with tanks, choppers, and enemy aircraft trying to stop you. Along the way you will need to fly over fuel depots to refuel your jet and keep flying.

Scoring 40,000 points or more entitled you to a River Raiders patch by sending proof to Activision along with $1.
