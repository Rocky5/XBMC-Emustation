The mad bomber is on the loose! As he races back and forth at the top of the screen, you need to catch the bombs he drops in buckets of water. One point is earned for each bomb caught, but miss one of the bombs, and Kaboom! As the levels progress, the mad bomber will move faster and faster and drop more and more bombs.

You start the game with three buckets, and lose one each time a bomb is missed. The game ends when all of your water buckets are gone.

This version was unique in that a player could control the mad bomber in head-to-head 2-player action. 

Scoring 1800 or more points in games 1 or 2 got you a "Bucket Brigade" patch if you sent a picture of your score to Activision.  If you ever score 10,000 points or more, the Mad Bomber will show you how impressed he is.  :o
 
On the 8-bit and 2600 versions the player uses a paddle to control the buckets.

Baby Roo has been kidnapped by monkeys, and it's up to Mama Roo to come to the rescue! Your kangaroo starts out at the bottom of the screen. You need to guide the kangaroo up the various ladders and platforms to the top where Baby Roo is being held captive.

The monkeys will be trying to stop you by throwing or dropping apples and knocking you off the platforms. Your kangaroo has boxing gloves, however, and can knock out the monkeys with a single punch! Along the way various types of fruit can be collected to earn bonus points.
