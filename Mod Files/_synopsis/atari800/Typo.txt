Typo is a one player game designed to develop skill in touch typing.  After inserting the cartridge you may start the game by depressing the start button.

The object of the game is to complete a path thru the maze without getting caught.  The letters or words you must type will appear in the center of the display.

The game has three modes of selection, random letters of the alphabet, random letters of the alphabet, random selection of predetermined 3, 4, and 5 letter words, and a random word selection of your own generated vocabulary.  The speed at which you must type to stay ahead of your captor in the maze is your only other selection.  You set the "words per minute" (WPM) speed that provides a challenge to your skill level, yet allows you to complete the maze and win your reward.
