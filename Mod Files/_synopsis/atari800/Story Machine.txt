Story Machine is a product aimed at children for teachning language skills. The product contains animations assigned to key nouns, and verbs. By typing phrases such as "The Girl Jumps Over the Flower" will show the player an animation of a girl jumping over a flower. Through this method, players are able to create short "stories" of about 40 words long and have the computer animate them. These stories are also limited to having 4 "actors" (animated noun objects) in each.
