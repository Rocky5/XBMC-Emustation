Bomber Attack is a real time fast action game that puts you in command of a supersonic bomber over enemey terrain.  You can see the enemy's factories, airstrips, ammunition dumps, and missile installations stretched out below your flight path.  Secured in your bomb bay are 25 ten-megaton superbombs.  YOUR MISSION: Drop all 25 bombs on key locations before the enemy can down your bomber.

But watch out for Red Cross hospitals as neutral ground, they're protected by the Geneva convention.  Pilots who bomb enemy hospitals are in for serious trouble.

As you try to complete your missions, enemy missile fire intensifies.  And unless you knock out the airstrips, an enemy fighter plane will take off and dog your bomber, atching you maneuver for manuever.  If you're a real ace pilot, you may be able to climb above and out-maneuver.  If you don't you'll have to attempt to complete your mission while dodging his fire.

Hit?  Don't give up!  As you pile up points, your crew is working to repair any damage.  You may have to land with a crippled bomber, but at least you will have a chance to fly again and complete your mission.  Three direct hits will send your plane plummeting to earth with the lives of your crew unlikely to be spared by the crash.  Fortunately, the first one hundred points you tally, and every 200 points thereafter, cancels one enemy hit.

Bomber Attack has three skill levels so you can start out as a trainer pilot and graduate to an ace.  "Pull up your flaps", you're off into the wild blue yonder leaving a wake of destruction as you zoom into immortal fame as a modern day fighter pilot.
