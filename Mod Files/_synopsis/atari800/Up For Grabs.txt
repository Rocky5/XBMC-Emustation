Do you like word games?  Then you'll love Up For Grabs.  Because it's fast paced, exciting, and educational all at the same time.

You've got to think fast.  Because you have to grab the letters you want off the rotating cube before anyone else does.  And then place them in your playing area and build words, as quick as you can!

But not so fast that you don't plan ahead.  Because those gray squares are double letter scores.  And letters that don't make words count against you.

Up to 4 people can play.  Or y ou can play alone, against the computer.  So develop your skill and quick wits.  And have a great time playing Up For Grabs.
