Obviously Donkey Kong-inspired, in Canyon Climber you try to climb to the top of the Grand Canyon, while avoiding various obstacles.

There are three levels, each a single screen:

In Level 1 you set bombs on each side of three bridges and then push the plunger at the top to blow them up, all while jumping or outrunning charging sheep.

In Level 2 you climb ladders and run up long paths to reach the top of the screen while jumping over arrows shot by indians.

In Level 3 you jump pits and climb ladders to reach the top while avoiding birds that drop bricks.
