This game is a 2D shooter. You 'll have to destroy the enemy's Magnet Power Station with your gun. There are only a few moments before the atomic turbine missile encounters the enemy. You, as pilot of a space fighter have to shoot your way though aliens. You can escape the danger by using warps and special objects - to be collected en route. The aliens will mutate in more dangerous forms the longer the live. So don't let the aliens survive.
