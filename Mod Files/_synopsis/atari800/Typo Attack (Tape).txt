These may look like ordinary fingers, but they're armed with the ability to touch type.  You're looking at the ten best friends you ever had, in the real world, and in the fast-paced action of Typo Attack.  Now you can give your fingers a fun workout, while you practive typing skills.  Typo Attack pits your developing digits against waves of animated invaders called typos, bent on destroying your bases.  You must type the character appearing in the base under attack to blast each typo.  Destroying one wave brings on another, with typos falling faster and characters changing more quickly.  Each typo that lands on a base chips away at part of its protective zone, until the base is totally destroyed.  The more you play Typo Attack, the greater your typing experience becomes.  So you can develop a truly formidable touch while having a lot of fun.  Now there's an entertaining way to master deadly skills.
