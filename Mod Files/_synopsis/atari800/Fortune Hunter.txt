Treasure awaits, yours for the taking.  But do you have what it takes to kill the guards and escape?  No guts, no glory.  It's a chancy game, and a little bit lonely.  Are you fast enough?  Smart enough?  Crazy enough?  Then this game's your meat.  It's up to you and your fast reaction times, if you've still got em...

Fortune Hunter is a one or two player game.  After inserting the cartridge and before you push the start button, you may select one or two players and the level of difficulty.

In two player mode the computer keeps track of the score and progress of the game.  Control of the games is passed back and forth between the first two joystick positions.

By depressing the option button before starting the game you change the level of difficulty of game.  There are nine levels of difficulty which control the speed of the game and automatically increments to the next level of difficulty on clearing the screen.

To start the game, depress the start button and maneuver the position dot on the screen with the joystick into one of the treasure roooms.  At that point the room will expand on the screen and your foes will appear.  You are armed with a bow and arrow to defend yourself and only have a short period of time to evade or destroy your foe and capture the treasure.

The object of the game is to score points by collecting treasures and destroying enemies.
