After you get all the way to the top, you enter Porky's Bar, where you have to travel the correct path up the scaffolding, planting charges as you go. If you get to the top, there will be a detonator and so long Porky's! If you fall and Porky catches you, it is off to the swamp.

Porky catches you=lose 200 points

What points you get for exiting the scaffolding depends on the difficulty you have set the game to. The points are from 100 to 3200.

The Swamp

If you get caught on any other screen, you end up here. You must pole vault up and release when in mid-flight to get up to one of the platforms.

The first time you are there, you have to collect bricks then place then on the wall on the other side until you can climb out. 

If you are sent to the swamp a second time, you can climb out right away but look out for Porky.

Place a brick=100 points

Getting out of the swamp screen=100 points

Each pole vault jump=lose 25 points

Falling into swamp=lose 100 points

Caught by Porky=lose a random number of points

Push the random object that appears at center, top into the pit at the bottom without getting caught by Ms. Balbricker or falling in the pit the climb out the top back to the county line. Every time you get through the shower, you stop or slow a lane on the highway.

You get 100 points for pushing an object into the pit.

You lose 200 points if you fall in the pit or are caught by Ms. Balbricker.

Every ten seconds you are in the shower, you lose ten points so don't dawdle.
