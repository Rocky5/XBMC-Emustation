Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top down point of view. You control a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon; your goal is to earn as many points as possible by shooting the numerous enemy creatures which wander about the maze like corridors.

The creatures wander about at various speeds, may shoot darts at you, and some even have the ability to disappear temporarily. At the bottom of the screen you have a radar which can be used to locate creatures that are invisible. When you complete a maze, a Worluk will sometimes appear. This creature moves rapidly and will only be on the screen momentarily. If you destroy it before it escapes, the next dungeon will become a double score dungeon and all creatures will be worth twice as many points.

Occasionally the Wizard of Wor himself may appear! He moves quick and can teleport around the maze. Destroy him and you'll earn a large amount of points. The game can be played by one player or two players simultaneously.
