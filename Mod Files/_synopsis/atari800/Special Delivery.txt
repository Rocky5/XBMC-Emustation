_________________________

In the main, horizontally scrolling section, Santa rides his sleigh and tries to collect presents being dropped by his helpers while avoiding clouds and mountains. The presents from the Red Devil should be avoided. If enough are collected, Santa can land on a house to deliver the presents personally. (Otherwise he can only drop them down the chimneys while flying.)

Going down the chimney means having to dodge flames from below and snowballs from above. Once inside the house, Santa can leave the presents under the Christmas tree, get the key to the door and leave. He fails if he wakes any of the sleepwalking children who are running from room to room.
