Demon Attack is an arcade action game with gameplay similar to Space Invaders. You control a laser canon at the bottom of the screen, and need to destroy wave after wave of brightly colored demons. The demons bounce around the screen in bizarre patterns, and try to destroy your canon with bombs or lasers. When you shoot a demon, it will be replaced with another or will split into two smaller demons depending on which wave you are playing. When the required number of demons for the current round is finally destroyed, you can move on to the next, more difficult round.

Imagic's best-selling game, and the focus of one of Atari's early litigations as it looks and plays very much like their port of the arcade game Phoenix. Imagic and Atari eventually settled out of court. Original game designed by Rob Fulop. This title only works on the older 400/800 models.
