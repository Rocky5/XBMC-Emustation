MasterType.  The typing instruction game.  The easiest way ever to learn to type and to get the most out of your computer.

Master Type is the one and only typing instruction program that's fun, not intimidating.  Master-Type combines the fast action of electronic arcade games with the best techniques for developing your typing skills.  After each action packed game, your score, average speed in words per minute, number of words typed and number of mistakes appears and you can see how you measure up.

From the four corners of your computer screen enemy words and letters hurl missiles at your command ship.  Your only defense is the MasterType, a powerful wizard who zaps words as fast as you can type them.  If you are quick and accurate, you will save the Universe.  If you make too many mistakes, you are doomed!
