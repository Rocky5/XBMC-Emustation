Star Wars Arcade is a 3D shoot 'em-up set in Episodes 4, 5, and 6 of the Star Wars saga. You take control of either an X-Wing or Y-Wing, and are put right in the middle of the space combat. In some levels, you have to shoot down a specific number of TIE fighters before time runs out. In other levels, your goal is to simply to make it to the end without getting blasted out of the sky.

Some of the missions take place in deep space, around asteroids, or near Star Destroyers. Other missions take place on the surface of the Death Star and re-create the Luke Skywalker's famous trench run to destroy it.

Hints:
