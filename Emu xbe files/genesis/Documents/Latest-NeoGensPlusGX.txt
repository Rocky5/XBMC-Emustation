* Updated to madmab edition interface CFv1b27. See "Interface Changelog.txt"

* Fixed up detection of redump.org images some more (grrrr).

* Game SFX volume is no longer saved with non CD game configurations for both cores.

* Some tweaks to the allocation/deallocation of various things to help allieve some memory issues (and crashes) for those using the PM3 skin.  I personally recommend dumping the PM3 skin, it is a memory hog.

http://xport.xbox-scene.com
goto http://www.emuxtras.net/ for latest cheats, rumbles, synopsis and skin updates.

* Updated to madmab edition interface CFv1b23. See "Interface Changelog.txt"

* For both emulators cleaned up the in-game menu "Change CD" code.

**************************
* Genesis Plus GX v1.09b *
**************************

* Implemented EkeEke's method of "working around" UMKT breaking due to code that handles ROM images which acccess CDDA data.  (It saves memory :P )

* Added code to handle J-Cart games.  You can now play 4 players on Codemasters j-cart games!  ( Pete Sampras Tennis, Pete Sampras Tennis '96, Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament, Micro Machines 96, Micro Machines Military, Super Skidmarks)

* Finally activated Sega TeamPlayer and EA 4-Way Play Multi-Tap code.  3 and 6 button pad support only.  If there are games that use other controls, let me know and I'll get them working.

* Finally got around to hooking up the XE-1 AP controls so you can now play games that use it.

* Tweaked the mouse code some so it should be more functional.  A real mouse is still kinda iffy.

* Added two new mouse options "Analog Mouse Sensitivity" for analog stick controlled mouse and "D-pad Mouse Sensitivity" for mouse control with the D-pad.  Range (for now) is 5 thru 50 (increments of 5) and 1 thru 10 respectively.

* Inverted mouse option was not showing when mouse was selected as a port device.  Fixed.

* A bunch of internal rewrites to the controller handling controls to get things working and hopefully less confusing.  Doi!

* Hooked up the "Change CD" code for the Genesis Plus GX core.

**********************
* Neogenesis v25.15b *
**********************

* CD_Unload code was crashing the emulator when a game would "open" the tray for a disc change on network accessed discs.  Fixed.

* In-Game Change CD option would crash when trying to select a "bin/cue" on a samba share.  Oopsie!  Fixed.

Cores - Gens (Neogenesis) v25.14b, Genesis Plus GX v1.08b, and possibly Meka

* Updated to madmab edition interface CFv1b21. See "Interface Changelog.txt"

* I originally had the change logs for the GX and GensX cores seperate.  I'm merging them back (starting with this version and the entries for the last version) into this text file.  I found the seperate format too confusing.

* Sega CD images were not loading properly when launching the Neogenesis core from the GX core.

**************************
* Genesis Plus GX v1.08b *
**************************

* The last update to handle ROM images that acccess CDDA data borked UKMT.  Fixed.

* Genesis Plus GX v1.07b *
**************************

Genesis Plus GX Sega Genesis/Megadrive/32X/SegaCD/MegaCD/SMS/GG Emulator for XBox v1.07b Madmab Ed

* Fixed issue where country region USA and Europe were switched.  Thus causing games to run at 50hz when Europe is selected and 60hz when USA is selected.

* Added in pixel perfect settings for SMS/GG so they should display correctly when using pixel perfect or fit to screen.  However if you use custom screen size with global set to yes there will be a mismatch between sms/gg and Genesis screens.

* A bunch of internal changes related to the sms/gg support.

**********************
* Neogenesis v25.14b *
**********************

* Updated to madmab edition interface CFv1b21. See "Interface Changelog.txt"

* Due to an improperly sized array the flicker filter level was resetting to 0 on game load.  Fixed.

* Sound from the genesis plus GX sound engine was being done improperly (incorrect variable types) and was causing weird issues on surround systems.  Fixed.

******************
* So What Is It? *
******************

This is a multicore emulator based off of two (possibly three emulator) cores.  (See above title).

Read the Readme-NeoGenesis.txt for all news regarding the Neogenesis core.

Genesis Plus GX core is by EkeEke.  Initially ported by A600 to SDLx.  

Mangled and converted to x-port (Madmab Edition) (and DirectX) by Madmab and XtecuterX73.

Core updates (to match latest core) done by XtecuterX73.

********************
* Why Multi-Cores? *
********************

Because I can?  LOL.  Actually Genesis Plus GX is so great that NeoGenesis is almost not even needed.  Note I said almost.  Unfortunately Genesis Plus GX does not have support for Sega 32x.  So I decided to incorporate both into one interface with selectable emulator core.  Also Genesis Plus GX does not support "Cue/ISO/MP3" image combos which NeoGenesis does support.  So there you have it.

FAQS

Q: Can I use my old Neogenesis saves?

A: Yes.  Simply rename your saves directory to "NeoGensPlusGX".  Also be sure to rename "NeoGenesis.ini" to "NeoGensPlusGX.ini".  You will also need to reconfigure your "saves directory to point to the new location.  This can be done from within the emulator "Configuration -> Change Default Directories".  Or you could manually edit the ".ini" file with a text editor.  You might also have to change other default directories depending if they are not relative to the "D:" directory.


Q: I select a game but it keeps on loading the Neogenesis core!

A: If you elected to keep your original Neogenesis saves directory (See above question).  A game with a save configuration will still use Neogenesis as the core.  You can change this by pressing X when selecting a game and manually changing the core.


Q: I set the core to Genesis Plus GX for my Sega CD image but it keeps on reverting back to NeoGenesis for the core.  Why?

A: Chances are the Sega CD image you are selecting is a "Cue/ISO/MP3" combination which Genesis Plus GX currently does not support.  So the interface automatically selects NeoGenesis for your confusion.. uh I mean convenience!


Q: What do I do about UMKT?

A: The UMKT specific Neogenesis core is still there if you need it.  However I would suggest using the Genesis Plus GX core.


Q: Genesis Plus GX is known to be able to play SMS and GG games.  Can I play these?

A: Yes but there is minimal madmab edition support ATM until I decide what to do about this.  No special controller support or pixel perfect yet.

* Sonic & Knuckles “Lock-On” hardware emulation.

* Support for ROM image up to 10MB (Ultimate MK3 hack).

* Configurable sound mixer (FM/PSG levels) and filtering (Low-Pass filter & 3-Band equalizer).

* Selectable console region.  (Auto, Europe, USA or Japan)

* System Lockups let you enable/disable emulation of illegal address access.  Needed for some demo's and homebrew.

* System TMSS let you enable/disable TMSS emulation and Genesis BIOS support.

* Lock-On let you enable/disable cartridge Lock-On emulation.  ( Game Genie, Action Replay, Sonic & Knuckles ).

* High-Quality FM, when enabled, let you emulate the FM synthesizer chip at its original frequency. 

* FM Volume let you adjust the volume ratio of the emulated FM synthesizer chip. (0~200%).

* PSG Volume let you adjust the volume ratio of the emulated PSG chip (0~200%)

* PSG Boost Noise, when enabled, let you boost the noise channel volume of the PSG chip. This might make some games sound more accurate but, most of the time, it’s generally better to leave it disabled.
