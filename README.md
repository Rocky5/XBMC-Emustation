# XBMC-Emustation

### Front end for some emulators, using XBMC

 This is a pet project of mine and its a combination of a skin, python scripts and source edits to XBMC. So don't expect something spectacular.

 I wanted something that looked like EmulationStation on the Xbox and the only way to do that was to make a skin for XBMC and use it's built in feature to launch .cut files.
 
 But it wasn't that simple, I wanted menu loading instant and there was no simple way to do that with over 700 roms or a few hundred games, so I modified the XBMC source to bypass the folder check for xbe files. This worked for games, but not roms, so again had to think outside of the box and came up with a workaround :) I create static menus when you scan your roms. There are also a few other scripts I made to do other tasks, but hopefully you like what I have made and get some use out of it.
