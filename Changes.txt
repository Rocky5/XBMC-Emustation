Previous Updates:

	2) Fixed scroll speeds for lists.
	3) Updated some of the scripts, create_rom_lists.py especially is now a bit faster.
		(faster the HDD the faster the scanning. DB scanning would be the fastest but as of right now it's not implemented.)

28/12/2023
	1) FTP 4GB file transfer issue fixed
		(Big thanks to Team Resurgent / EqUiNoX)
	2) Fixed returning to rom list not working.

		(menus and sources when in xbe edit mode)
	4) Fixed scanning of Xbox games, it wasn't scanning all games in.
	5) Most systems scanned in will now be sorted alphabetically like XBE content is.
	6) Two new options for the scanner menu, ignore "the" when sorting and remove articles fro the end of names.
	7) Fixed synopsis naming for roms, so now the order matches the names :D
	8) Can now sort systems by alphabetical order or system ID.
	9) Higher resolution system logos and also for all themes. Redownload required.

	10) New menu for changing theme colours if they have more than one.
		(Under the UISettings > Customise menu)
	11) Made changes to variables and other structures so themes will need to be redownloaded on release to be usable with this version.
	12) Fixed returning to the home screen if using the video layout.
	13) Should have fixed all issues loading roms when using the video layout mode.
	15) Back-end changes to allow more features & some streamlining.
	16) Updated mames synopsis files
	17) Updated mame autoload.xbe to 2023 source.
		(full emulator is on the downloader)
	18) Fixed the scanning script not fixing digit names.
		(XBMC will parse them as localized labels if I don't fix them)
	19)	Moved all skin files over to <left> and <top> like gamers.
	20) Added check to the create_roms_lists.py that will notify you if you have roms for a system nut no emulator.
		(this is instead of it erroring when it gets to N64 or other systems that I use files for)

	21) Added support for custom scan paths via "Q:\emustation\custom_scan_paths.ini". This is update proof so set it once and leave it be.
	22) Added CPU and MB temps to the debug info.
	23) Removed the update check from the advanced settings menu and the script.

	Example:
		[Games]
		E:\Games\

		E:\Homebrew\
		F:\Homebrew\
		G:\Homebrew\

08/07/2023
	1) Added support for SD resolutions.
		(Big thank you to loggio for doing all the SD theme xml sizing, without him I wouldn't have added SD support. Downloader now supports SD resolutions also.)
	2) Update the play_preview.py script, streamlined it a bit, removed .strm support and made it start your play list after a video.
		(If you have startup playlist enabled and audio was playing)
	3) Updated the auto_play_preview.py script, streamlined it and improved it a bit.
	4) Moved the layout overlay outside of the menu_loader.py script.

	6) Favs title will auto hide if no favourites are present.
	7) Few new variants for the background images on the carousel.
	8) Added Homebrew to the carousel, so you can use that instead of ports etc...

	16) Fixed the favourites menu not being themed if using Simple Alt.

	26) Fixed ports previews not loading.

	29) Fixed the Options background for Xbox and Ports not showing. (white button)

		connected but not valid network, or hard crash the system if you disconnect and reconnected a Ethernet.
	45) Mame can now have favourites and also fixed when selecting a fav the user could move. (was allowed)
	46) Can now sort favourites by system-alphabetical or just alphabetical.

	2) Like above it now shows it scanning through the files checking for the correct casing.
	3) Fixed the N64 synopsis creation part of the code, now will remove white spaces from the beginning of the files.

	2) Updated the "DialogProgress.xml" to reflect the above changes.

	6) Updated "create_rom_lists.py" to show an error if it cannot find any roms/images when in manual mode.

	9) Updated "create_rom_lists.py" to parse the system types of FBL roms so they get loaded by the correct xbe file.

	10) New "FBL Rom Names.zip" for FBA, so please use this or you wont get the fix above.
	11) Synopsis added for 3883 FBL roms, and the "create_rom_lists.py" will now parse these.
	12) Update to the center label fix in lists, if your skin version is 2.1 it will use the old way and if its 2.2 or higher will use the fixed way.

		( if you wish that is, you get a choice )
	7) Updated "create_roms_lists.py" to ask whether you want to parse the names from the synopsis files or just use filenames.
	8) Updated "create_roms_lists.py" to add the rom path to the N64 surreal/-ce.ini files so roms auto load.

	14) New screen calibration screen, should make it simpler to proportion your screen correctly.
	15) New bat file for adding "Name: " to the beginning of each synopsis file that come form emulators.

	16) Removed Atari Jaguar CD as there is no emulator for this, only the Atari Jaguar.
	17) Made Neo Geo CD direct launch only as the emulator doesn't support command line launching.
	18) New settings look, to closer match the rest of the system.
		( isn't finished but it's a start )
